<h2>Abstract</h2>
<span class="markdown">
We present the Enslaved Ontology which was developed for integrating data about the historic slave trade from diverse sources in a use case driven by historians. Ontology development followed modular ontology design principles as derived from ontology design pattern application best practices and the eXtreme Design Methodology. Ontology content focuses on data about historic persons and the event records from which this data can be taken. It also incorporates provenance modeling and some temporal and spatial aspects.
