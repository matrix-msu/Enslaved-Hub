He was a son of the almaami of Futa Jallon, a Muslim theocratic ruler. Abd al-Rahman was raised in Timbo, the capital of Futa Jallon, where he studied the Koran as a young boy. He went on to study further in Jenne and Timbuktu, two major centers of learning, located in present day Mali.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn 1788, while leading a trade delegation to the coast, Abd al-Rahman was ambushed and captured. He was then brought to the Gambia River, where he was sold to an Englishman, John Nevin. \\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.slavevoyages.org\\/voyage\\/80087\\/variables\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EHe was shackled and brought to the West Indies on the Africa along with 177 others, 164 of who disembarked in Dominica after 34 days of the Middle Passage.\\u003C\\/a\\u003E Around one-third of them, including Abd al-Rahman, were purchased by another ship owner, who sailed them to New Orleans before continuing on to Spanish Natchez (Mississippi). In Natchez, Abd al-Rahman alongside another slave, Samba, who had been with him since Futa Jallon, were sold to Thomas Foster for the combined price of $930, and continued on to Foster&rsquo;s plantation outside of Natchez.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESoon after arriving on Foster&rsquo;s plantation, Abd al-Rahman ran away. Weeks later, after finding little help from the outside world, he returned. He became referred to by his master and others on the plantation as &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; in reference to his claimed (and true) royal bloodline and regal bearing. Abd al-Rahman eventually came to oversee the plantation, and while he had been married in Futa Jallon, he remarried on Foster&rsquo;s plantation, assuming he would never return home. Along with his wife, Isabella, he had five sons and four daughters.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHis royal lineage became accepted publicly after a chance meeting in 1807 with a doctor named John Coates Cox. Cox was the first European to have spent time in Abd al-Rahman&rsquo;s hometown of Timbo, where he spent six months while recovering from an illness before Abd al-Rahman&rsquo;s enslavement. Cox had even lived within Abd al-Rahman&rsquo;s family compound. After recognizing him, Cox confirmed Abd al-Rahman&rsquo;s heritage, which had been doubted by Foster and others on the plantation. He attempted to buy Abd al-Rahman&rsquo;s freedom from Foster, who refused to sell him given his important role on the plantation.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn 1826, Abd al-Rahman wrote a letter home in Arabic, but because of confusion (a local newspaperman who helped him assumed he was from Morocco), his letter was in fact sent to the U.S. Consul in Morocco. After the Moroccans requested Abd al-Rahman&rsquo;s freedom, U.S.Secretary of State Henry Clay recommended his release to none other than the U.S. President, John Quincy Adams. In response to the Secretary of State&rsquo;s request, Foster released Abd al-Rahman in 1828, on the condition that he leave the United States.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESupported by the American Colonization Society and African American leaders in the North, Abd al-Rahman attempted to raise enough money to buy his family&rsquo;s freedom, and was eventually able to free his wife and and some of their children. He sailed to Africa in February 1829 on a ship headed for Liberia, with the help of the U.S. government. He died a few months after returning to West Africa. Illness prevented him making the final journey of several hundred miles to his homeland of Futa Jallon. A year after his death, however, Isabella, would welcome eight children and grandchildren to Liberia, where the family would settle.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.35432\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Allan D.

Some accounts both from Jolof and from those who knew her in Florida suggest that she may have been a princess. Others believe her father was a member of the royal family who unsuccessfully challenged for the Jolof throne.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nHistorians believe that Anta was captured during a raid of the Jolof kingdom in 1806. While it is &nbsp;not exactly known when she was captured, or what ship brought her to the Americas, it is known that she arrived in Cuba in 1806. In late September or early October, Anta was sold at auction to Zephaniah Kingsley, a slave trader and planter in the province of Spanish Florida. On October 24, Kingsley&rsquo;s ship, the \\u003Cem\\u003EEsther\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, docked in the port of St. Augustine, where he registered Anta and two other new slaves with the Florida provincial government. In the Americas, Anta&rsquo;s name was changed to Anna Madgigine Jai Kingsley.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nIt is unclear, but it seems possible that Zephaniah Kingsley married the thirteen-year-old Anna before leaving Cuba. Regardless, by the time they arrived at Laurel Grove Plantation, Kingsley&rsquo;s home south of present-day Jacksonville, Anna was pregnant with his child and was to live in his house as his wife. Between 1806 and 1811, Zephaniah and Anna Kingsley had three children in total: George, Martha, and Mary. On March 4, 1811, soon after Mary&rsquo;s birth, Zephaniah emancipated Anna and their three children. Zephaniah&rsquo;s business ventures across the Caribbean and the east coast of the United States meant he was rarely at home, and so Anna managed the plantation in his absence. Zephaniah had several other slave &ldquo;wives&rdquo; with whom he fathered many children, but Anna was the only one who lived in the house. Zephaniah used the term &ldquo;wife,&rdquo; but there are no written records of official marriages,\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nIn 1812, the year after gaining her freedom, Anna moved across the St. John&rsquo;s River and built a home on five acres granted to her by the Spanish government. She continued to manage Lauren Grove, her husband&rsquo;s plantation. During the Patriot Rebellion, pro-U.S. settlers,with the support of the U.S. government, rebelled against the Spanish crown. Zephaniah Kingsley was abducted almost immediately after the rebellion started and was held hostage. Laurel Grove was destroyed by Seminole allies on the orders of the governor of Florida, and eventually Anna burned her own property to prove her loyalty to Spanish Florida. As a result, after the war the Spanish granted Anna 350 acres for her loyalty. During this time, Anna also converted to Catholicism, which helped her establish relationships with important people throughout Spanish Florida.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nAfter the rebellion ended Anna and Zephaniah bought a new plantation on St. George Island, not far from where Lauren Grove had been. The new property was known as Kingsley plantation, and would be where Anna and Zephaniah&rsquo;s fourth child, John, was born in 1824.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nIn 1819, the Adams-Onis Treaty ceded Florida to the United States. Unlike under Spanish law, free people of color had little rights in the United States. Under U.S. law, interracial marriage was banned, mixed-race children could not inherit their parents&rsquo; property, and newly freed people of color had to leave Florida. Because Anna&rsquo;s marriage and emancipation predated these laws, she was exempt from these new laws but the environment for Anna and her family continually worsened.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nIn an effort to find a better situation for his family, Zephaniah Kingsley decided to move his family to Haiti. He arranged for the leasing of a 35,000 acre plantation near Puerto Plata (today in the Dominican Republic) named Mayorasgo de Koka. Anna, along with two of her sons and sixty slaves moved to the plantation in Haiti between 1836 and 1838. Because Haiti had abolished slavery, Anna&rsquo;s slaves were freed, but became indentured laborers. Zephaniah remained in the United States where he died in New York City in 1843. In 1846, Anna returned to Florida to argue for her inheritance, which was being challenged by Zephaniah&rsquo;s sister. However, in 1846 the Superior Court of East Florida ruled in Anna Kingsley&rsquo;s favor.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nAfter receiving a large portion of her husband&rsquo;s estate, Anna bought a twenty-two-acre farm along the St. John&rsquo;s River in Chesterfield, just across from Jacksonville. Until 1862, Anna lived in this community of free blacks and slaves. Historians believe that Anna likely evacuated to the Union-held town at Fernandina on Amelia Island. After the Civil War, with most of her wealth destroyed, Anna went to Jacksonville to live with her daughter Mary until her death in 1870.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.37187\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Bethany Waywell Jay in the \\u003Cem\\u003EAfrican American National Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/kora.enslaved.org\\/files\\/16-23-92871\\/Anna_Madgigine_Jai_AANB.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EView complete story (pdf)\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.49171\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Deborah Bauer in the \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of African Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EKathy Tilford., &ldquo;Anna Kingsley: A Free Woman.,&rdquo; OAH Magazine of History 12 (1997):&nbsp;\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/web.archive.org\\/web\\/20080511161300\\/http:\\/\\/www.oah.org:80\\/pubs\\/magazine\\/women\\/tilford.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/web.archive.org\\/web\\/20080511161300\\/http:\\/\\/www.oah.org:80\\/pubs\\/magazine\\/women\\/tilford.htm\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EFrom the National Parks Service:\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E&ldquo;Anna Kingsley: A Free Woman&rdquo;:&nbsp;\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.nps.gov\\/timu\\/learn\\/historyculture\\/kp_anna_freewoman.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.nps.gov\\/timu\\/learn\\/historyculture\\/kp_anna_freewoman.htm\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnna&rsquo;s Manumission Paper and Will:&nbsp;\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.nps.gov\\/timu\\/learn\\/historyculture\\/kp_anna_manumission_will.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.nps.gov\\/timu\\/learn\\/historyculture\\/kp_anna_manumission_will.htm\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHistory of Kingsley Plantation:&nbsp;\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.nps.gov\\/timu\\/learn\\/historyculture\\/kp_history.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.nps.gov\\/timu\\/learn\\/historyculture\\/kp_history.htm\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EZephaniah Kingsley:&nbsp;\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.nps.gov\\/timu\\/learn\\/historyculture\\/kp_zk.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.nps.gov\\/timu\\/learn\\/historyculture\\/kp_zk.htm\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp xmlns=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.w3.org\\/1999\\/html\\\"\\u003EBauer, deborah l.. &quot;Kingsley, Anna Jai Magigdine.&quot;&nbsp;\\u003Cem\\u003EDictionary of African Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, edited by Ed.

Nothing is known of her childhood, but in November 1821, she attracted the attention of a 27-year-old merchant named Ildefonso Coronel. He purchased her and secured a house for her in Guayaquil. Batallas later said that he did not force himself upon her, but rather courted her, promising to free her if she responded voluntarily to his advances.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt the time, Bol&iacute;var was leading wars of independence against Spain throughout the continent. In 1820, the liberal political forces of Guayaquil declared independence and established the &ldquo;Republic of Guayas.&rdquo; The new government immediately prohibited the importation of slaves and then declared that as of July 21, 1821, all children born to current slaves would be freed on their eighteenth birthday. In 1822, Bol&iacute;var&rsquo;s forces permanently liberated the region that is now the country of Ecuador from Spanish control and Bol&iacute;var established his headquarters in Guayaquil.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMeanwhile, Batallas had entered into a relationship with Coronel and given birth to a daughter, Mar&iacute;a del Carmen. Coronel legally recognized the child, implicitly freeing her, but he did not free Batallas as promised. Instead, he took up with another woman and moved Batallas into that woman&rsquo;s house as a slave. Batallas secured allies and went to court, where she used the language of liberation then in vogue in addressing the judges. The court removed Batallas from Coronel&rsquo;s possession, but rather than freeing her, it appointed a temporary master to care for her. This was a typical outcome of lawsuits brought by slaves.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUnsatisfied and aware of the current political developments, Batallas walked to Bol&iacute;var&rsquo;s headquarters one day in March 1823 and asked to meet with him. She insisted she would not leave until this happened. Her story was compelling, and Bol&iacute;var shortly thereafter sent a letter to the court demanding justice on her behalf. Most likely, Bol&iacute;var was motivated by not only by his ideals, but also by a recognition that the struggling young government desperately needed the support of the populace, including the enslaved. Batallas was not famous in her time. But, like many other slaves, she used her knowledge of the struggle for independence to further her own case and vocalized the connections between her individual plight and the broader plight of unfree peoples and nations.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.50806\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Camilla Townsend in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003E&ldquo;Batallas, Angela&rdquo; in\\u003Cem\\u003E Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&ldquo;Bol&iacute;var, Sim&oacute;n&rdquo; in \\u003Cem\\u003EDictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&ldquo;D&iacute;az, Mar&iacute;a Chiquinquir&aacute;&rdquo; in \\u003Cem\\u003EDictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003ETownsend, Camilla. &quot;Batallas, Angela.&quot;&nbsp;\\u003Cem\\u003EDictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography&nbsp;\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, edited by Ed.

He married another of Bennett&rsquo;s enslaved people, Mary. Their lifelong marriage produced at least four children. Sometime after 1635, the Johnsons acquired their freedom (presumably through self-purchase) and relocated to Northampton County. Anthony acquired a small farm around 1640 and became a prosperous cattle and hog breeder. He did so well that in 1651 he was able to purchase 250 acres from neighboring planters to form a modest estate on Pungoteague Creek in Accommack County. There, Johnson embarked on a career as a tobacco farmer, which was temporarily halted by a fire that destroyed most of his property in February 1653.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nThe fire forced Johnson to seek government relief in the form of a tax waiver, which the county granted, excusing Anthony and Mary from paying taxes on their two daughters for the remainder of &ldquo;their naturall lives.&rdquo; This extraordinary ruling, attributable at least in part to patronage from Bennett and possibly others, allowed Johnson to reestablish himself. Other court records from the period confirm his rising status and that he owned black slaves.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nDespite the fire that nearly destroyed his original estate, Johnson was able to establish himself as a well-connected middling planter by 1660. He and his family formed the core of a vibrant, free black planter community in Northampton. In 1665 the entire Johnson clan pulled up stakes and moved to Somerset County, Maryland, where profits from land transfers and subsequent sales between Anthony Johnson and his sons allowed the latter to become formidable planters in their own rights. Anthony leased a 300-acre plantation that he named &ldquo;Tonies Vineyard,&rdquo; where he and his wife lived until their respective deaths, his in 1670 and hers around 1675.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nAfter emancipation, Johnson fully participated in the local planter culture, sharing his white neighbors&#39; preconceptions about property rights and the legitimacy of slavery.

Before and after Fernandes was forced to return permanently to Portugal in 1771 (to resolve family disputes), Chica and her children lived a lavish lifestyle in a prominent home among the local elite, owned wealth in slaves, belonged to important religious brotherhoods, and received educations that helped them make socially advantageous marriages and career moves.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EChica died in Tejuco in 1796 and was buried in a prominent church location normally reserved for the local white elite, a demonstration of the importance and prestige she had accrued. Historical, literary, and popular media representations of Chica have portrayed her as either a social climber lacking in grace, beauty, spirit, and education; or as a symbol of black women&rsquo;s sensuality and the Brazilian propensity for race-mixing. The real Chica was neither the redeemer of her race, nor a shrew and seductress. She knew, as was common for freedwomen of the period, how to take advantage of the few possibilities that the system offered her. Her actions among the white elite of Tejuco were always aimed at promoting the social ascension of her descendants and diminishing the stigma that color and slavery had imposed on her.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.73637\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by J\\u00fania Ferreira Furtado in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EChica da Silva\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (song), 1963 \\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=EvY-DO1HiVo\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=EvY-DO1HiVo\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&ldquo;Looking Back at Xica da Silva, Who Went From Slave to Brazilian Elite, On the Big Screen&rdquo; \\u003Cem\\u003ERemezcla\\u003C\\/em\\u003E \\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/remezcla.com\\/film\\/looking-back-at-xica-da-silva-who-went-from-slave-to-brazilian-elite-on-the-big-screen\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttp:\\/\\/remezcla.com\\/film\\/looking-back-at-xica-da-silva-who-went-from-slave-to-brazilian-elite-on-the-big-screen\\/\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EXica da Silva \\u003C\\/em\\u003EFilm \\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.imdb.com\\/title\\/tt0078512\\/?ref_=nv_sr_2\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.imdb.com\\/title\\/tt0078512\\/?ref_=nv_sr_2\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EXica da Silva\\u003C\\/em\\u003E Telenovela \\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.imdb.com\\/title\\/tt0138277\\/?ref_=nv_sr_1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.imdb.com\\/title\\/tt0138277\\/?ref_=nv_sr_1\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EBergad, Laird W. \\u003Cem\\u003ESlavery and Demographic and Economic History of Minas Gerais, Brazil, 1720&ndash;1888\\u003C\\/em\\u003E.

Galanga, his family, and other fellows of his village were captured and sold into slavery, eventually working as gold miners in the town of Vila Rica (today Ouro Preto), in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Galanga was baptized Francisco (sometimes reported as Francisdo da Natividade, Francisco Lisboa da Anuncia&ccedil;ao, or Francisco L&aacute;zaro), which is often shortened to Chico in Portuguese.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EChico smuggled gold out of the mines in his hair, eventually accumulating enough to purchase his freedom. He then became very prosperous and bought a gold mine in Vila Rica, which allowed him to buy the freedom of his family and other members of his village. Another version of the story states that Chico&rsquo;s former master gave him the gold mine as thanks for his good service. Once a freedman, Chico Rei and his fellows built the Church of Saint Iphigenia in Vila Rica, which houses the Catholic Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Rosary (a black brotherhood).\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENo primary sources confirm the story, making it hard to determine whether the legend emerged during the period of slavery or more recently. The first known reference to Chico Rei appeared in the book \\u003Cem\\u003EHist&oacute;ria antiga de Minas\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (1904), by Brazilian historian, Diogo Luiz de Almeida Pereira de Vasconcelos. Since then, the story has spread widely in Brazilian popular history and memory.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ELocal Afro-Brazilian associations in Minas Gerais named groups after Chico Rei to promote the history of Afro-Brazilian heroes. In 1946 the son of a local resident, while playing in the courtyard of his mother&rsquo;s house, discovered a mine entrance that was blocked with stones. Convinced that her son had found the Encardideira gold mine described in \\u003Cem\\u003EHist&oacute;rias da terra mineira,\\u003C\\/em\\u003E Maria B&aacute;rbara de Lima named it Chico Rei&rsquo;s Mine and installed artificial illumination along the one-mile deep mine shaft. It remains open to public visitation and houses a small restaurant.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlthough not based on documentary evidence, Chico&rsquo;s tale amalgamates elements of the real experiences of several different enslaved individuals who came from Africa to work in the gold mines of the interior of southeastern Brazil and eventually purchased their own freedom. His story also helps to construct a biography of an enslaved hero in a country that, despite having imported the largest number of Africans to the Americas, has long undervalued its Afro-Brazilian historical actors.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.73638\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Ana-Lucia Araujo in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EChico Rei \\u003C\\/em\\u003E(film), 1985 \\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.imdb.com\\/title\\/tt0088906\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.imdb.com\\/title\\/tt0088906\\/\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cem\\u003EChico Rei\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (song), 1964 \\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=CUbnMkAeWaQ\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=CUbnMkAeWaQ\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp xmlns=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.w3.org\\/1999\\/html\\\"\\u003EAraujo, Ana Lucia. &quot;Chico Rei &ldquo;Galanga&rdquo;.&quot;&nbsp;\\u003Cem\\u003EDictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography&nbsp;\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, edited by Ed.

He was taken captive by Portuguese slave traders around 1830, having previously worked as a slaver in the Portuguese-African trade taking place in modern-day Togo, Benin, and Nigeria. As a child, D&acirc;aga was adopted by the Popo King Madershee after his imposing physique attracted the attention of the sovereign. Modern medical science suggests that his size, standing at about 6&rsquo;5&rdquo; tall with long feet and a face dominated by a long jaw, is possibly indicative of a human growth disorder such as gigantism or acromegaly. These physical features were interpreted by many as symbolic of both strength and power, possibly providing an explanation for his adoption by the Popo leader. As he matured, D&acirc;aga&rsquo;s imposing physique was put to use in the Popo slave trade, capturing Yorubas (from present-day Nigeria) and selling them at slave markets in Grand Popo (Benin) and Little Popo (modern-day An&eacute;ho in Togo).\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt some point, D&acirc;aga was betrayed by his Portuguese allies in the slave trade who carried him into the transatlantic slave trade alongside Yoruba slaves that he had brought to market. The captives on the Portuguese ship gave D&acirc;aga the nickname Longa Longa in reference to his impressive size. While at sea, D&acirc;aga set to planning a rebellion with his fellow captives but the ship was seized at sea by the British Navy who, following the 1807 criminalization of the slave trade, pursued any slavers regardless of their nationality of origin. D&acirc;aga and the other slaves were then taken to the British Caribbean &nbsp;as recaptives or liberated Africans, terms used to refer to those slaves from ships captured by the British Navy and enlisted as soldiers in the British First West India Regiment. During a time of great unrest in the Caribbean following the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of slaves between 1834 and 1838, these regiments were used in place of British soldiers, as authorities thought soldiers of African descent could better resist tropical diseases and withstand harsher climates than their British counterparts. Upon his enlistment in the Regiment, D&acirc;aga was renamed Donald Stewart by his officers and may also have been referred to as King&rsquo;s Man, a moniker used by British African soldiers.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EJust as he had attempted to bring about a &nbsp;rebellion on his slave ship, D&acirc;aga began to plan a mutiny soon after his enlistment in the British First West India Regiment. On the night of June 17, 1837, along with 280 other black soldiers, D&acirc;aga mutinied at the Saint Joseph Barracks in Trinidad. The soldiers, under D&acirc;aga&rsquo;s leadership, chanted Yoruba war chants and burned their garrisons to distract the white officers while they continued to the armory and seized weapons. Although these black rebels did face off against their white officers, no white soldiers were killed. The mutineers then fled on foot from Saint Joseph toward the town of Band de l&rsquo;Est, which was commonly known as an ideal launching point to flee for Venezuela, suggesting that the mutineers&rsquo; plans centered on escaping military service and resettling either on the South American mainland or finding some means to return to West Africa.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA small group of mutineers marched East to the town of Arima and clashed with a local militia comprised of Afro-Trinidadian, African, Spanish, and Portuguese men. While D&acirc;aga attempted to join his compatriots in Arima, he was captured and condemned to death by court-martial. Although the mutineers&#39; officer Lieutenant-Colonel Bush attempted to save the soldiers from the death penalty, this sentence was confirmed by the imperial authority in Barbados on August 14, 1837. Sources suggest that while facing the death squad D&acirc;aga pushed down his blindfold and refused to face the rifles, forcing the soldiers to shoot him in the back. Witnesses at the execution reported that D&acirc;aga&rsquo;s last words were: &ldquo;The curse of Holloloo on white men. Do they think that D&acirc;aga fears to fix his eyeballs on death?&rdquo; D&acirc;aga was buried near the grounds of the Saint Joseph barracks on August 16, 1837.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlthough his rebellion was short-lived and no monument or memorial exists to honor him, D&acirc;aga remains a powerful symbol of black resistance in Trinidad. In the late 1920s, anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits discovered evidence of a seven-day-long festival celebrating the rebellion at Saint Joseph.

It was composed of several \\u003Cem\\u003Emocambos\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (village-sized communities) united to form a neo-African kingdom. Some inhabitants of Palmares were Brazilian born, while others were from Africa, especially West Central regions such as Angola. Palmares became economically self-sufficient by diversifying agricultural production. Colonial authorities perceived this self-sufficiency to be a threat to the system of slavery in Brazil and sought to resettle or eliminate the maroons. The quilombo resisted incursions from both the Dutch and the Portuguese to survive for nearly a century.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn 1678, Ganga Zumba, the leader of Palmares, accepted a peace treaty offered by the Portuguese governor of Pernambuco. This treaty required the people of Palmares to relocate to the Cuca&uacute; Valley, which Dandara feared would lead to the destruction of the Republic of Palmares and a return to slavery. Although she had once fought alongside Ganga Zumba, she opposed the terms of the treaty. Dandara is probably also responsible for convincing her husband, Zumbi (possibly Ganga Zumba&rsquo;s nephew), to oppose the treaty as well. Zumbi challenged Ganga Zumba and led a revolt opposing any concessions to colonial authorities, creating a division within Palmares. Soon after, Zumbi succeeded Ganga Zumba as the leader of Palmares.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EScholars have uncovered several different versions of Dandara&rsquo;s death. Some sources say that she was killed on February 6, 1694 with other residents of Palmares when Cerca Real dos Macacos (the settlement within Palmares ruled by Zumbi) was destroyed. Other sources contend that Dandara jumped off the highest mountain peak of the quilombo after Palmares fell, preferring suicide to a return to enslavement.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPalmares is generally regarded as the largest and longest-lived fugitive community in Brazil. In 1978, the date of Zumbi&rsquo;s death (November 20) was instituted as the Brazilian National Day of Black Consciousness. Ultimately, quilombolas like Zumbi and Dandara have come to symbolize a tradition of black resistance in Brazil. They maintain this symbolic importance as Afro-Brazilians continue to struggle for racial and social equality.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.73747\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Erica Lorraine Williams in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\",\"Online Resources\":null,\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EBest, Leslie K. \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Afro-Latino: A Historical Journey\\u003C\\/em\\u003E.

During the Great Depression, between 1936 and 1938, the Works Project Administration (WPA) sent unemployed writers across the country to interview ordinary people and record their life histories. After the initial phase, John A. Lomax, the National Advisor on Folklore and Folkways for the FWP, was struck by the ex-slave interviews and in 1937 sent out writers to seek out former slaves. Garlic&#39;s interview was conducted during this phase and stands out as a record of life under slavery; many consider her account to be one of the most critical recorded during the FWP project. Unlike others, Garlic did not speakly with fondness about the slave era, instead stating plainly: &quot;Dem days wuz hell.&quot;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EClaiming to be one hundred years old at the time of her interview, Garlic was the youngest of thirteen children born to a slave woman in Powhatan, Virginia sometime around 1837. She never knew eleven of her siblings or her father, being taken by slave speculators as an infant, along with her mother and brother William, to Richmond, Virginia to be sold at auction. Delia and her mother were sold to a Henrico County sheriff named Carter, while William was sold to another buyer and never seen by his mother or sister ever again. When the FWP interviewer asked if children cried during the auctions, Garlic responded directly: &quot;Course dey cry; you think dey do not cry when dey was sold like cattle? I could tell you &#39;bout it all day, but even den you couldn&#39;t guess the awfulness of it.&quot;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn her interview, Garlic also detailed the quotidian experiences of household slaves. Caring for her master&#39;s granddaughter, the child hurt its hand and began crying, which caused the child&#39;s mother to &quot;pick up a hot iron and run it all down my arm and han&#39;. It took off the flesh when she done it.&quot; When Carter remarried, his new wife also abused Garlic for mimicking her makeup by darkening her eyebrows. When the master&#39;s new wife saw what Garlic had done, she yelled, &quot;You black devil, I&#39;ll show you how to mock your bettes&quot; and picked up a stick of firewood and hit her upside the head. Delia attempted to run away after Carter threatened to have an overseer &quot;beat some sense in her&quot;, but returned to the home where a speculator was waiting to take her to be sold again. At 100 years old, she still remembered her last moments with her mother, saying,&quot;She pressed my han&#39; in both of hers an&#39; said: &#39;Be good an&#39; trus&#39; in de Lawd.&quot; In her interview, Garlic reflected on the role of hope for slaves. &quot;Trustin&#39; was de only hope of de pore black critters in dem days. Us jest prayed for strength to endure it to de end. We didn&#39;t &#39;spect nothin&#39; but to stay in bondage till we died.&quot;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAfter being taken from Carter&#39;s home, Garlic was sold first to a hotelier in McDonough, Georgia, then a businessman in Atlanta and later to a planter named Garlic in Louisiana. On Garlic&#39;s farm, she worked as a field hand, &quot;plowin&#39; an&#39; hoein&#39; an&#39; choppin&#39; cotton.&quot; On his farm, Garlic said she &quot;didn&#39;t know nothin&#39; &#39;cept to work.&quot; Waking at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning, she ate a piece of cornbread for breakfast and supper and boiled greens, beans, and peas for dinner. Although this was a typical meal plan for slaves, others were able to supplement these diets with vegetables they grew themselves, Garlic noted that her owners provided her with &quot;no way to cook, nor nothin&#39; to cook in our cabins.&quot;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBefore the Civil War, Garlic married a man from another plantation named Chatfield but never saw him again after he was forced into service for the Confederates in 1861. Later, she married a man on her plantation named Miles Garlic. When the War ended, Garlic remembered that &quot;everybody wanted to git out.&quot; After the birth of her second child, she moved to Alabama to raise her family, first in Wetumpka and later to Montgomery. Very little was discussed by Garlic and the interviewer about her life between this time and the time of the interview.

Lindsay and Belle met in the West Indies. Lindsay is thought to have found Maria Belle on a Spanish slave ship that his forces captured in the Caribbean, later taking her as his wife under the system of pla&ccedil;age, wherein European men entered into civil unions with African women. Dido Belle spent part of her childhood in Pensacola in Spanish Florida, where Captain Lindsay was stationed from 1764 to 1765. Afterward, Lindsay brought Dido to England to stay with his uncle, William Murray, the first Earl of Mansfield, and Murray&rsquo;s wife. The couple was childless, already raising Elizabeth Murray, their great niece, and took Dido into their household, presumably as a companion for Elizabeth. She was baptized in St. George&rsquo;s Church, the parish church of Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s house in Bloomsbury Square, in London on November 20, 1766, at the age of five.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlthough not their birth child, the Mansfield family granted Dido an allowance, gifted her expensive presents, and did not hide her presence in their household. Dido&rsquo;s presence in the Mansfield home caused some to doubt whether Lord Mansfield, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, could provide unbiased verdicts in cases involving enslaved persons. In Somerset v. Stewart, Mansfield ruled in favor of James Somerset, an enslaved African purchased by custom officer Charles Stewart in Massachusetts. Stewart later took Somerset with him to England in 1769; Somerset later escaped in 1771. After recapturing Somerset, Stewart had him imprisoned on the \\u003Cem\\u003EAnn and Mary\\u003C\\/em\\u003E ship bound for Jamaica in 1771, instructing that he be sold back into slavery. Somerset&rsquo;s godparents applied for a writ of\\u003Cem\\u003E habeas corpus\\u003C\\/em\\u003E resulting in the trial brought before Lord Mansfield. Mansfield ruled in Somerset&rsquo;s favor, granting him his freedom. He commented on the &ldquo;odious nature&rdquo; of slavery in his ruling:\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe state of slavery is of such a nature that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political, but only by positive &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasions, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory. It &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESimilarly, in the case of the Zong Massacre, Mansfield found the captain and crew of the British slave ship\\u003Cem\\u003E Zong\\u003C\\/em\\u003E guilty of the mass killing of 133 African slaves on November 29, 1781. When the ship ran low on potable water, the crew threw their cargo overboard to drown. When they reached port at Black River, Jamaica, the Zong made claims to their insurers for the cargo they lost. When the insurers refused to pay the claim, Mansfield found, in Gregson v. Gilbert (1781), the captain and crew at fault for the killing of the slaves. This case increased publicity for the abolitionist movement, representing a powerful symbol of the horrors of slavery in the Middle Passage, with Olaudah Equiano bringing news of the massacre to the attention of Granville Sharp, an English abolitionist, who later attempted to find the crew guilty of murder.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Mansfield home in Bloomsbury Square was damaged in the anti-Catholic Gordon Riots of 1780. From that point forward, the Murray family moved to the Kenwood House in Hampstead Heath. At Kenwood House, the Murrays placed Dido in charge of the dairy and poultry yards and appointed her as Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s assistant. When Thomas Hutchinson, former Loyalist governor of Massachusetts, visited Kenwood in 1779, he was shocked that Dido shared coffee with the family after dinner, also marveling at the close relationship between Dido and Lady Elizabeth. Accounts suggest that Dido also acted as Lady Elizabeth&rsquo;s lady&rsquo;s companion. This close relationship between Dido and Lady Elizabeth was captured in a double portrait by Johann Zoffany painted in the late 1770s (Zoffany is also attributed to a solo portrait of Dido painted circa 1778). Another visitor to Kenwood, James Beattie, a Scottish poet and philosopher, reflected in his \\u003Cem\\u003EElements of Moral Science\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (1807) on his own visit, finding Dido charming and impressive. &ldquo;But I happened, a few days after, to see his theory overturned, and my conjecture established by a negro girl about ten years old, who had been six years in England, and not only spoke with the articulation and accent of a native, but repeated some pieces of poetry, with a degree of elegance, which would have been admired in any English child of her years,&rdquo; Beattie noted.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen John Lindsay passed away in 1788 he failed to leave his inheritance to Dido, instead leaving it to two other illegitimate children. Perhaps Lindsay assumed that the Mansfields would provide for Dido, which proved true when Lord Mansfield left Dido a lump sum of &pound;500 and an annual income of &pound;100 upon his death in 1793. Mansfield also confirmed Dido&rsquo;s freedom in his will. On December 5, 1793, Dido married John Davinier in St. George&rsquo;s Church in Hanover Square. Though little is known about Davinier, he is thought to have been a Frenchman working as the steward for a family in Mayfair, a very important position as he ran the entire estate for the family. Dido and her husband had at least three sons, with her twins, Charles and John, being baptized on May 8, 1795 and another son, William Thomas, being baptized on January 26, 1802. Dido died around age 43 in July 1804.

In the mid-eighteenth century she was taken captive, sold into slavery, and transported to Newport, Rhode Island, where she became a domestic slave in prominent attorney William Channing&rsquo;s home.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ELike many female slaves, Quamino was responsible for a variety of household activities. She particularly excelled in baking, a skill which would sustain her in later years. Quamino converted to Christianity while a slave of the Channing family. By 1769 she had married John Quamino, an African slave owned by Captain Benjamin Church. John later purchased his freedom with the earnings from a winning lottery ticket. The couple had at least three children&mdash;Charles (born in 1772), Violet (1776), and Katharine Church (1779).\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe American Revolution disrupted Quamino&#39;s life in many ways. In the early autumn of 1779 she learned of her husband&#39;s death. He had enlisted as a privateer, presumably in an effort to earn enough money to purchase his wife&#39;s freedom and died in battle with the British in August. Now suddenly alone, Quamino gave birth to their last child, whom she named Katharine Church and baptized in October.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EQuamino apparently had secured freedom for herself and probably her children by 1780. Local folklore suggests that she baked her way to freedom, using the Channings&#39; oven to make pastries that she sold to locals. Like many newly freed blacks, Quamino remained in the same household as a servant, and she was entrusted to care for the family&#39;s newest member, William Ellery Channing. Born in 1780, he would later gain fame as a prominent Unitarian clergyman and abolitionist, possibly influenced by Quamino&rsquo;s presence in his early life.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBy 1782, Quamino established an independent household. At the same time, she was gaining local fame as a cake baker. Folklore has it that Quamino still used the Channings&#39; large oven to &nbsp;bake for these events, and often expressed her gratitude by hosting members of the family for tea in her home.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen Quamino died at age sixty-five, her death offered a rare opportunity to bring black and white Newporters together.

His career as an explorer began in 1528 with the disastrous Florida expedition of P&aacute;nfilo de Narv&aacute;ez. Narv&aacute;ez landed in Tampa Bay and marched part of his forces into the interior, searching for riches. Overwhelmed by native forces near present-day Tallahassee, the Spaniards fled south to the coast. When they realized their ships were gone, the stranded explorers constructed five barges and sailed west along the Gulf coast until fierce storms off of Texas sank three of the barges. In November 1528, the survivors landed near present-day Galveston.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEsteban and fifteen other men survived the winter only to be enslaved by Karankawa Indians. Only Esteban, his master Andr&eacute;s Dorantes, Cabeza de Vaca, and Alonso del Castillo Maldonado survived to escape from their captors five years later in 1534. The four wandered across modern-day Texas and northern Mexico, presenting themselves as healers and religious figures called &ldquo;Sons of the Sun.&rdquo; Esteban was particularly adept at learning languages, functioning as an interpreter.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA chance encounter with Spaniards in northwestern Mexico ended the group&#39;s years of wandering. Despite their truthful reports of very little wealth, their return to Mexico City sparked excitement about the lands north of Mexico. When the three European survivors refused to head an expedition, Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza purchased Esteban and sent him on Fray Marcos de Niza&rsquo;s 1539 journey in search of wealth.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBy previous arrangement, Esteban ranged several days&#39; journey ahead of the Franciscan, maintaining his &ldquo;Son of the Sun&rdquo; persona to ensure safe passage and leaving crosses of various sizes to signal the magnitude of his findings. Esteban experienced no trouble until he reached the Zuni pueblo of Hawikuh. Disregarding a warning to stay away, he proceeded into the pueblo where he was taken prisoner and then executed by Hawikuh&rsquo;s authorities in the spring of 1539.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWord of Esteban&#39;s fate reached Fray Marcos, and he decided against entering the pueblo. From afar, the bright sun made Hawikuh&rsquo;s adobe apartments gleam gold. Fray Marcos returned to Mexico City convinced he had found the fabled golden city of C&iacute;bola. Eager to exploit such riches, the viceroy quickly organized another expedition under Francisco V&aacute;squez de Coronado. In Hawikuh, Coronado found only mud huts and a few stones of turquoise.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEsteban&#39;s appearance in Hawikuh made a lasting impression on the Zunis.

Arobe and his brother Juan Mangache were two of the &ldquo;mulatto&rdquo; leaders of Maroon communities began by his father in the late 1550s and 1560s. By 1577, Francisco&rsquo;s father had been killed in confrontations with nearby native communities. In that year the maroon leader, Alonso de Illescas, attempted and failed to submit Francisco and Juan to his leadership.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt an unknown date, Arobe married a woman named Do&ntilde;a Juana and had at least two sons. By the 1580s, the brothers were dealing directly with Spanish colonizers. In 1586 Juan repeatedly traveled to Quito, where he received gifts from Rodrigo de Ribadeneyra in exchange for assistance in establishing a colony of Spanish settlers in Esmeraldas. In 1589, Arobe placed his community under the religious instruction of Mercedarian Fray Juan de Salas. Arobe is credited with establishing a church and founding the village of San Mateo, which he and his people further populated after 1598. The records show little additional activity until the late 1590s. By then, Arobe had gained a reputation for assisting shipwrecked travelers who washed up on the Esmeraldas coast. Royal judge Juan Barrio de Sepulveda traveled to Esmeraldas in order to pacify the Maroons, resulting in Francisco traveling to Quito in 1599 with two of his sons, Pedro and Domingo, to pledge his loyalty to the Crown.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOn this visit, the royal court commissioned a now famous portrait by the native artist Andr&eacute;s Sanchez Galque. In the painting the honorific &ldquo;don,&rdquo; a title of minor nobility, precedes the names of Arobe and his sons. Judge Barrio described them as rulers over Esmeraldas and &ldquo;lords of the land.&rdquo; Arobe also received the military title of captain. The portrait was sent as a gift to King Philip IV, and it remained in the royal collection until the late nineteenth century. While Arobe disappears from the historical record after 1599, his progeny would continue to rule over the Maroon communities for generations. In addition, his portrait is considered the first signed painting of the Americas and has become one of the most recognized portraits of the early colonial period.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.50723\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Charles Beatty Medina in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003ECheek, Sheldon. &ldquo;Regal Trio&rsquo;s Historic Link to Escaped Slaves and South America&rsquo;s Indigenous Tribes.&rdquo; \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Root\\u003C\\/em\\u003E.

In 1726 Men&eacute;ndez was appointed captain of St. Augustine&rsquo;s black militia, which was active in raids against Carolina and in defense of St. Augustine. Men&eacute;ndez also became literate and petitioned the new governor to free him and thirty other blacks who had come to Florida or Havana under Spain&rsquo;s religious sanctuary policy. &nbsp;The governor acceded in 1738 and granted freedom for all slaves who had fled or would flee from Carolina.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt the same time, he established a fortified community for free blacks under Men&eacute;ndez&rsquo;s leadership.

He was born in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (today Haiti) to two slaves, Carlos and Diana. His mother, Diana, was a slave who worked at Providence Hospital with the Fathers of Charity, in Cap-Fran&ccedil;ais, then the colonial capital. Biassou worked as a slave driver on a Jesuit sugar estate in Haut du Cap, the inland part of Cap-Fran&ccedil;ais.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nOn August 14, 1791, Biassou, alongside other slave drivers, met at the Lenormand de M&eacute;zy Plantation in Haut du Cap to plan a revolt. Eight days later, thousands of slaves in northern Haiti sabotaged their plantations, setting fire to fields and houses. After the death of the leader of the revolt, Boukman Dutty, Biassou and Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois took command of the slave army. While Toussaint Louverture is often thought of as the father of the Revolution, Biassou and Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois led the army in its initial phase.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nAfter months of fighting, on December 4, 1791, Biassou and his fellow leaders sued Haiti&rsquo;s Colonial Assembly for peace. Though the revolt was initially designed to gain freedom for plantation slaves, Biassou, Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois, and Toussaint offered to return slaves to their plantations as long as they were freed, alongside their families and their fellow officers. The French Assembly rejected their offer, as well as another offer later in December, and the rebellion continued.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nIn January 1792, Biassou led several raids on Cap-Fran&ccedil;ais, while Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois captured the important town of Ouanaminthe on the border with Spanish Santo Domingo (today the Dominican Republic). While the rebellion continued, the abolition movement in France gained steam, and in April the French National Assembly granted the right to vote to free people of color. However, the Colonial Assembly in Haiti continued to maintain unwavering support for slavery.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nEvents in Haiti changed rapidly following the toppling of the French King Louis XVI in August of 1792. After Louis was executed in October, Spain and England declared war on France. Following this declaration of war, both the Spanish and English reached out to the rebels in the hopes of gaining control of Haiti. In the summer of 1793, Biassou and the other rebel leaders accepted the Spanish alliance. Under the Spanish crown, Biassou and Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois continued to struggle against the French. Tension increased between the two rebel leaders as they battled for control over the Spanish troops during the second half of 1793 and the first half of 1794.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nIn the summer of 1794, following the declaration by the French Assembly abolishing slavery, Toussaint rejected the Spanish and joined the French Republican forces. Biassou and Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois remained loyal to Spain. In 1795, Spain and the French Republic signed a peace treaty accepting French control over the western half of Hispaniola (Haiti) and agreeing to disband the black auxiliary troops led by Biassou and Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois. On December 31, 1795, the disbanded troops headed for Havana, where Cuban officials refused to allow them to get off the ship.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nWhile Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois sailed to Spain, Biassou traveled in January of 1796 to Spanish Florida, settling in St. Augustine along with his wife, her mother and siblings, and seventeen of his former troops and their family members. Biassou immediately clashed with the Spanish governor, who saw him as acting above his station. Biassou&rsquo;s brother-in-law Juan Jorge Jacobo, his second-in-command, married Rafaela Witten, daughter of Prince Witten, an important soldier who had fought against the French in Florida.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nStarting in 1800, the Seminole Indians attacked plantations around St. Augustine, and Biassou helped lead Spanish troops against these raids. It was while taking part in these skirmishes that Biassou became sick and died on July 13, 1801. Biassou was buried in St. Augustine&rsquo;s Tolomato Cemetery in a large Catholic funeral, accompanied to the graveyard by drummers and an honor guard. In recent years, Florida&rsquo;s Haitian-American community have sought to bring Biassou&rsquo;s accomplishments in his time in Florida to the public consciousness, and local government officials have put a placard on his house (which was restored during the 1960s) at 42 St. George Street in St. Augustine commemorating this leader of the 1791 Haitian slave revolt\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.36191\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Jane G.

Smart was born around 1750 in the town of Kalangba in present-day northern Sierra Leone. His birth name was Koko, and he was a member of the Loko ethnic group. His father was named Kande Gbanka Kalangba, and was the chief of Kalangba.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs a young man, Smart accidentally killed his brother in a palm tree-tapping incident and fled from Kalangba. While fleeing, he was captured by raiders who sold him to British traders at Bunce Island, an important slaving port about twenty&nbsp;miles upriver from the modern-day city of Freetown, Sierra Leone&rsquo;s capital. These traders employed&nbsp;him, giving him the nickname &ldquo;Smart&rdquo; because of his trading abilities. Like most European traders, they avoided the African interior as much as possible, and so sent Smart on their behalf to purchase slaves in the interior, supplying him with alcohol, cloth, and other goods to do so. Smart used these goods to quickly gain wealth, buying slaves for less than he had been given. At Bunce Island, Smart also learned English, which allowed him to serve as an important go-between. Eventually, he did not return to Bunce Island with either the goods he had been given or the slaves he was supposed to purchase.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESmart moved further into the interior, marrying two women in different areas to create alliances to increase his political and economic power. At this point, he was based in the town of Mahera, east of Freetown. He joined the Wunde Association, a Mende organization that provided him with military training and support, since the Mende were the dominant group in the interior of southern Sierra Leone. After his initiation, he adopted the first name Gumbu, meaning &ldquo;fire&rdquo; in Mende. Gumbu Smart began to buy Loko slaves, and then freed them in exchange for their loyalty. He also would trade slaves of other ethnic groups, like the dominant Temne of northern Sierra Leone, in exchange for his fellow Loko. With his growing group of supporters, Smart settled along the Rokel River in the town of Rokon around 1788. For most of this time, Smart&rsquo;s primary focus was on promoting trade.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOver the next decade, Smart supported the British in Freetown, helping them in their war against the Temne. At the same time, Rokon developed into an important trading town between people in the interior and the British on the coast. Rokon was the point farther upriver navigable by ship, and thus served as an important waypoint for moving goods to the coast. Primarily dealing in slaves, Smart became one of the most powerful traders in Sierra Leone. In 1794, the Freetown Colony surgeon Thomas Winterbottom described Rokon as the &ldquo;most considerable town I have seen hereabouts.&rdquo; As of 1797, a British trader reported that &ldquo;his adherents amount to several Hundreds, exclusive of his own family who consists of no less than thirty wives and eighty children alive.&rdquo; Later, it was reported he had several thousand followers, and Rokon contained over 1000 people. &nbsp;In Rokon, Smart built military fortifications filled with his warriors. Smart welcomed contact with Europeans, and was happy to bring two missionaries into Rokon, where they opened a small school in 1798.

There he left Jan Rodrigues to trade with Native Americans.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhat happened thereafter is conveyed mainly through a series of lawsuits between Mossel and Dutch traders. These lawsuits provide almost all of what we know about Rodrigues. When captain Adrian Block returned to Holland after mapping Long Island Sound and trading with Native Americans, he was sued by Mossel for violating his exclusive trading rights. Key to the suit was the freedom status of Rodrigues as either Mossel&rsquo;s slave or a free man acting independently.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBlock asserted that Rodrigues was a free man, and not a servant or an employee as Mossel claimed. His presence as a free trader, Block insisted, was evidence that Mossel did not enjoy a trade monopoly on the island.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn April 1614, Mossel returned to North America. Rodrigues fired on Mossel&rsquo;s new ship (the Nachtegael) at first sight. Mossel&#39;s crew chased the &ldquo;black rascal&rdquo; and briefly apprehended him. Though wounded, Rodrigues took a sword away from one of his pursuers and escaped. Later he found refuge on board another captain&rsquo;s boat. The episode suggests both that Rodrigues was Manhattan&#39;s first non-Native American merchant and that he considered himself to be free. Mossel claimed that Rodrigues&#39;s actions proved that he was a renegade servant or employee, but in ruling against Mossel, the court found implicitly that Rodrigues was a free man.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ERodrigues&rsquo;s trading post did well, and he was clearly in Manhattan for long stretches in the 1610s and 1620s. He may have still been in the colony when the Dutch West Indies Company (DWIC) arrived in Manhattan to pursue the fur trade in 1625. By some accounts, Rodrigues fathered children with one or more Native American women.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ELike other Atlantic Creoles Rodrigues was among those navigators, traders, pirates, and fishermen who traversed the Atlantic as free men during the early colonial period. Their presence suggests the porous nature of sixteenth and seventeenth-century racial lines, which allowed people of African descent to be employed and even rise to positions of authority in a world suffused with African slavery.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.37767\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Christopher Paul Moore in the \\u003Cem\\u003EAfrican American National Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ENational Park Service. &ldquo;The Life of Jan Rodrigues&rdquo; \\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.nps.gov\\/afbg\\/learn\\/historyculture\\/jan-rodrigues.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.nps.gov\\/afbg\\/learn\\/historyculture\\/jan-rodrigues.htm\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nNiven, Steven. &quot;Jan Rodrigues:The 1st Black Man to set Foot on the Island of Manhattan.&quot; \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Root\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, February 1, 2016.\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theroot.com\\/jan-rodrigues-the-1st-black-man-to-set-foot-on-the-isl-1790854070\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.theroot.com\\/jan-rodrigues-the-1st-black-man-to-set-foot-on-the-isl-1790854070\\u003C\\/a\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EBerlin, Ira, Leslie M.

Although his exact origins are not known, the majority of African slaves sold by the British Royal African Company and&nbsp;shipped to South Carolina originated in Kongo. The Kingdom of Kongo was an independent kingdom which converted to Christianity in the 16th-century, meaning that Jemmy worshipped both Roman Catholicism and older African faiths and had working knowledge of Portuguese which was the lingua franca of slave traders and the elite in Kongo. Jemmy&rsquo;s Kongolese origins also linked to his abilities as a military leader which was probably acquired in wars fought in the Kongo region in the early 1700s. These wars, by the 1720s and 1730s, were fought using pistols and muskets, meaning that knowledge of modern military tactics and weaponry were brought along with slaves, like Jemmy, to South Carolina. Jemmy also likely had knowledge of rice cultivation, which made him particularly skilled for work on plantations in South Carolina.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nAlthough it is unclear how long Jemmy had been in South Carolina when the Stono Rebellion broke out in 1739, he was part of a rapidly growing slave population in the region, resulting not only in an increase in the volume of rice exports but also the population of young, male, African-born slaves. These young men strained against the long hours of rice cultivation and resented being forced to perform agricultural tasks typically performed by women in Kongo. In the 1730s over 250 South Carolina slaves fled to nearby Florida, then a Spanish colony, where the authorities offered freedom to escaped slaves both to counter British influence in the United States and also to offer refuge to fellow Catholics. In August 1739, the tensions between Britain and Spain threatened to spill over into a full war, causing the South Carolina legislature to pass the Security Act requiring that all white men carry firearms to church on Sundays.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nOn September 9, 1739, Jemmy and twenty fellow slaves were working on a road gang near the Stono River bridge. Before dawn, Jemmy led the men to a nearby store where they stole firearms and ammunitions and then killed the two men guarding the store. The group then moved to the house of a man named Godfrey, burning down his home and killing Godfrey, his son, and his daughter. They then moved to Wallace Tavern, sparing the innkeeper but killing his neighbors and over twenty other whites. Soon after, they gathered more munitions and progressed south, accumulating more rebels as they travelled. Other slaves fought against Jemmy and the rebels and notified authorities who gathered a militia to face off with the rebels at Edisto River bridge. Fourteen slaves were killed in this standoff, while others escaped into the woods, presumably continuing to Florida to gain their freedom. It is unclear whether Jemmy was among those who was killed at Edisto Bridge or if he made it safely to St. Augustine.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nThough not as deadly as similar revolts in Jamaica and other British colonies in the Caribbean, the events in the South Carolina low country in&nbsp;September 1739&nbsp;persuaded colonial authorities to take swift action to avoid a repeat of Jemmy&#39;s uprising. In&nbsp;1740, for the first time in South Carolina&#39;s history, the legislature enacted a rigid slave code so that potential rebels such as Jemmy would be &ldquo;kept in due subjection and obedience.&rdquo; This slave code gave slaveholders more power to regulate, control, and punish their slaves. It also prohibited slaves from assembling in groups, learning to read, or even earning their own money. Such measures largely succeeded in preventing further large-scale slave revolts in South Carolina during the colonial period.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.37200\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Steven J.

His mother, Tonamata, was the wife of a notable Fulbe cleric. At a young age he achieved renown for his intelligence, learning to read and write Arabic and studying the Koran. He also had success as a trader.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn 1730 or 1731, when he was in his late 20s, Job&rsquo;s father sent him to sell two slaves to an English trader, Captain Stephen Pike. After unsuccessful negotiations, he crossed the Gambia River and sold his slaves. On his way home, he was captured by Mandinka slavers&nbsp;who sold him and his translator to the same captain Pike, who commanded the slave ship \\u003Cem\\u003EArabella\\u003C\\/em\\u003E.

Being of noble birth, he was a poor agricultural laborer and soon fled from the plantation. He was caught and jailed for several months where he was eventually visited by an attorney Thomas Bluett, who determined that Job was Muslim, and thus likely from a particular part of West Africa. As Job did not speak English, a Senegambian slave was found to translate to the Wolof language, which he knew. After learning that he was a runaway slave, Job was sent back to Tolsey&rsquo;s plantation.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn an effort to return home, Job wrote a letter in Arabic to his father in Bundu, explaining his fate, and asking for money for his freedom. His letter was seen by James Oglethorpe, a lawyer, deputy governor of the Royal African Company, and one of the founders of Georgia, which was originally intended as a slave-free colony. Oglethorpe had the letter translated from Arabic, and upon reading it, decided to arrange for Job&rsquo;s freedom himself. After his purchase&mdash;Oglethorpe paid forty-five pounds to compensate Tolsey&mdash;Job sailed to England in 1733 to finalize his freedom. He arrived in London and impressed scholars in England with his intelligence, writing the Koran from memory. Job became such a celebrity that he was even introduced to the King and Queen of England. He also sat for a famous portrait, which currently hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in London.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn 1734, Job finally gained his freedom, and returned to Senegambia as a free man. His own experience in captivity did not, however, turn him against the slave trade. He worked on behalf of the Royal African Company to improve British trade positions against the French. His work was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1737, he was imprisoned by the French, but later released. Little knowledge of the last decades of Job&rsquo;s life exists, but it appears he died around 1773.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.37188\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Allan D.

He was born March 25, 1762 in the town of J&eacute;r&eacute;mie, to Alexandre-Antonie Davy de la Pailleterie (known as Antoine), a French aristocrat, and Marie-C&eacute;sette-Dumas, a black slave owned by Antoine. Antoine&#39;s brother Charles was a rich sugar plantation owner who lived on the north coast of the island in the area of Monte Cristo. His father and Charles clashed often, and in 1748 Antoine left Monte Cristo, never to see his brother again until Charles&rsquo; death in 1773. He established a small cacao plantation with his slave and concubine Marie-Cessette. It was at this plantation in J&eacute;r&eacute;mie where Thomas-Alexandre Dumas was born in 1762. French colonial law meant that Dumas inherited his mother&rsquo;s status as a slave.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen Charles died in 1773, his father Antoine left Haiti for France to try to claim his inheritance. Antoine was not well off, and sold Marie-Cessette, Dumas&rsquo; mother, alongside her two daughters to pay for his passage to France. Dumas, his favorite, was only pawned. After Antoine successfully obtained Charles&rsquo; estate, Antoine sent for Thomas-Alexandre. He arrived in France in 1776 at the age of sixteen. He lived in Paris with his father, a marquis, where he was part of high society and educated as a nobleman. His relationship soured with his father after Antoine married his housekeeper and lowered his son&rsquo;s allowance.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn 1786, Thomas-Alexandre decided to join the French military. Because he was mixed-race, he was unable to join as an officer&nbsp;so he entered at the lowest rank. His father, ashamed that his noble son was serving at a level beneath him, forbid him from using his family name. From that point forward, he was known as Alexandre Dumas, taking his mother&rsquo;s last name.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen the French Revolution began in 1789, Dumas&rsquo; military career became much more successful. It was also during this period where he met his wife, Marie-Louis Labouret, while his regiment was based at Villers-Cotter&ecirc;ts, northeast of Paris. As a member of the revolutionary Army of the North, he was quickly promoted to corporal, and by 1793 had been promoted to first brigadier general, and later general of division (the equivalent of a U.S. four-star general). During the French Revolution, Dumas earned great praise for his actions. He saved many lives at the Champ de Mars Massacre in 1791, and captured a large German-Austrian enemy patrol that was marching on Paris in 1792 without firing a shot. His rise through the military was facilitated by the departure of much of the aristocratic officer corps during the Revolution. Dumas became the highest-ranking black leader in a modern white society for almost two centuries.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDuring the Revolutionary period, Dumas served as commander-in-chief of the Army of the Western Pyrenees in 1793, the Army of the Alps in 1793-4, and the Army of the West in the Vend&eacute;e in 1794. While the head of the Army of the Alps, he commanded 53,000 white troops who captured the western Alps. Dumas also provided key intelligence in the 1796 siege of Mantua, but Napoleon omitted his role from official reports, and lowered Dumas&rsquo; command in&nbsp;anger. Dumas gained back Napoleon&rsquo;s trust after defeating an Austrian squadron with a small unit of men in northern Italy, and Dumas was then appointed to govern the conquered province of Tr&eacute;visan in northern Italy.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDumas even became commander-in-chief of calvary when Napoleonic forces invaded Egypt, helping to stamp out the revolt of Cairo in 1798. During a desert march, Dumas criticized Napoleon&rsquo;s leadership, and after a dispute, Dumas requested to return to France. On his way back to France, his ship began to sink, and he sought safe harbor in the Italian city of Taranto. In Taranto, Dumas was taken prisoner and held for two years in an enemy prison of the Holy Faith Army.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAfter Napoleon returned to France and seized power, he continued his conquests and defeated the army of King Ferdinand IV of Naples and Sicily, securing Dumas&rsquo; release. However, the relative freedom for people of color during the early Revolutionary period soon led to Dumas&rsquo; downfall. Napoleon particularly targeted Dumas given their history, denying him of his full pension and refusing his admission into the French Legion of Honor. He even had Dumas replaced by a blonde, white man in a painting of the French capture of Cairo&rsquo;s Great Mosque. The events of these years weighed heavily on Dumas&nbsp;who died at the age of 43 on February 26, 1806 in Villers-Cotter&ecirc;ts as a result of stomach cancer.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDumas&rsquo; name and story strike many as familiar today, as a result of his much more famous son, the writer Alexandre Dumas. Alexandre&rsquo;s famous novel \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Count of Monte Cristo \\u003C\\/em\\u003Ewas inspired by his father&rsquo;s life and travels, and he featured his father in his novella \\u003Cem\\u003EBlanche de Beaulieu.\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFor almost two centuries, Alexandre Dumas&rsquo; role in Revolutionary France was underplayed and relatively forgotten, primarily due to racism. In recent years, however, his trailblazing role in the French military has returned&nbsp;to the public eye. In 2002, Dumas was interred in the Panth&eacute;on, a mausoleum in Paris for great French men. In the nineteenth century, the writer Alexandre Dumas attempted to get a statue built of his father, which eventually neared completion around the outbreak of World War I. After the war, the statue was forgotten, only to be destroyed during World War II by occupying Nazi forces as &ldquo;offensive.&rdquo; In 2009 a monument to Dumas was unveiled in Paris. The monument is a set of shackles, one open and the other closed, to represent Dumas&rsquo; slave origins and his eventual freedom. The monument also refers to all victims of French enslavement.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.73842\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Eric Martone and Tom Reiss in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EDaniel Brown, &ldquo;France&#39;s first black general once fought a cavalry squadron by himself &mdash; and emerged unscathed,&rdquo; \\u003Cem\\u003EBusiness Insider,\\u003C\\/em\\u003E March 13, 2018:&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.businessinsider.com\\/thomas-alexandre-dumas-france-first-black-general-napoleon-bonaparte-2018-3\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttp:\\/\\/www.businessinsider.com\\/thomas-alexandre-dumas-france-first-black-general-napoleon-bonaparte-2018-3\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nHenry Louis Gates, Jr., &ldquo;Who Was Napoleon&rsquo;s &lsquo;Black Devil,&rdquo; \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Root\\u003C\\/em\\u003E:\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theroot.com\\/who-was-napoleons-black-devil-1790898131\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.theroot.com\\/who-was-napoleons-black-devil-1790898131\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nMimi Geerges Show interview of Tom Reiss, author of Dumas&rsquo; biography, \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Black Count\\u003C\\/em\\u003E:\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=vQmwvvMMsbQ\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=vQmwvvMMsbQ\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nBritish Library gallery of Thomas-Alexandre Dumas:\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.bl.uk\\/onlinegallery\\/features\\/blackeuro\\/dumasfather.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttp:\\/\\/www.bl.uk\\/onlinegallery\\/features\\/blackeuro\\/dumasfather.html\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nNPR Weekend Edition, &ldquo;&#39;The Black Count,&#39; A Hero On The Field, And The Page,&rdquo; discussion of \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Black Count\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, September 15, 2012:\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.npr.org\\/2012\\/09\\/15\\/160969342\\/the-black-count-a-hero-on-the-field-and-the-page\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.npr.org\\/2012\\/09\\/15\\/160969342\\/the-black-count-a-hero-on-the-field-and-the-page\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\",\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EDumas, Alexandre. \\u003Cem\\u003EMy Memoirs.\\u003C\\/em\\u003E translated by E.M.

Graweere worked as a servant near James City (now called Jamestown) for white colonist William Evans. It is not clear whether Graweere was a slave or a servant for a fixed term but like most early Virginia settlers, white and black, he probably helped to cultivate and harvest his master&#39;s tobacco. Court records show that Graweere was also permitted to raise hogs and keep half the profits (the other half going to his master). Such arrangements were subject to the master&rsquo;s whims, because unlike white servants, there were no formal contracts between black laborers and their masters in colonial Virginia.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEarly Virginia&rsquo;s frontier conditions afforded African settlers somewhat greater freedom in social relations than in later years. Around 1635, Graweere married an African-born woman, Margaret Cornish, who worked as a servant for white colonist Lieutenant Robert Sheppard. A few years later the couple had a child, named Mihill, or Michael. By 1640 Graweere had saved enough money to purchase Michael&#39;s freedom from Sheppard, but a question soon arose as to whether the child now belonged to his own father or to his father&#39;s master, William Evans. To settle this dispute, John Graweere became one of the first Africans to petition the Virginia courts. In its 1641 decision, the court granted his request, though the decision appears to have taken religious arguments as the basis for the child&rsquo;s freedom, with Graweere expressing a desire to raise him as a Christian.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOther contemporary cases, such as the one involving Robert Sweat, show that Africans and Afro descendants were not treated equally to whites before the law.

He brought Knight to work as a personal servant on his new estate. In Scotland, Knight received instruction in reading, writing, and the Christian religion before baptism. However, Wedderburn and Knight quarreled over the latter&rsquo;s choice of partner&mdash;fellow servant Ann Thomson. After Thomson became pregnant, Wedderburn discharged her from service. Nevertheless, Knight married Thomson in Edinburgh in 1773. Wedderburn refused to pay him full wages or to provide accommodation for the couple, which escalated the conflict.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen he read about the Mansfield decision in which a slave named James Somerset was freed in England, Knight assumed this ruling applied in Scotland and promptly ran away to be with his wife in Dundee. Wedderburn initiated court action with local authorities who supported his position. Although he had no written contract, Knight appealed, claiming Wedderburn had agreed to release him from servitude after seven years. The sheriff of Perthshire issued a famous ruling in 1774 denying Wedderburn&rsquo;s claim on the grounds that slavery was not recognized by Scottish law.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWedderburn appealed to the Court of Session in Edinburgh (Scotland&rsquo;s highest court). He argued that he was entitled to Knight&rsquo;s perpetual service, citing ancient precedents for slavery, the British Parliament&rsquo;s authorization of the slave trade from Africa, and the principle of slaves as legal property in the colonies. Knight&rsquo;s defender argued that domestic slavery in Africa was reserved for criminals and captives in war, which did not apply to Knight. Furthermore, he asserted that colonial laws were not applicable in Scotland and that the perpetual servitude demanded by Wedderburn was contrary to the spirit of the established Presbyterian Church. The eventual 1778 decision was split and heavily qualified, but the court ultimately upheld the Perthshire decision and released Joseph Knight from slavery.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThough his wife bore a child, there is no record of the life of Joseph Knight after 1778.

In the 1770s he was carried across the Atlantic by slave traders to Sullivan&#39;s Island, South Carolina. Charleston planter Peter Whitten purchased Whitten and named him Big Prince, perhaps in reference to his great size. Big Prince became a carpenter on Whitten&#39;s plantation and by 1777 he had formed what would be a lifetime bond with an enslaved &ldquo;county-born&rdquo; woman named Judy on a neighboring plantation. Within two years Judy and Prince had a son named Glasgow and a daughter named Polly.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the tumultuous period of the American Revolution, the Whitten family was seized and moved to Georgia by a loyalist commander.

Most of the known details from Garrido&rsquo;s life come from a 1538 petition in which he solicited royal favor for his participation in Spanish conquests.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nProbably born in West Africa in the late fifteenth century, Garrido traveled at a young age to Lisbon. He was either free on arrival or obtained freedom while there. Garrido later went to Seville and joined a Spanish expedition sailing for the island of Hispaniola in the 1500s.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nGarrido took part in military campaigns against the Hispaniola natives known as the Ta&iacute;no and there he found a patron in Juan Ponce de Le&oacute;n. As a recent arrival with little wealth, he served as a footman in Ponce de Le&oacute;n&rsquo;s 1508 conquest of Puerto Rico and the 1512-13 expedition where he claimed Bimini and La Florida for Spain. Garrido thus became the first African known to have reached the present day United States\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nAfter also serving in the conquest of Cuba, Garrido apparently returned to Puerto Rico where he had a small gold mining operation. In November 1518, he sailed west from Santiago under Hernando Cort&eacute;s on what would become the conquest of the Aztec Empire in Mexico. Several native codices from the conquest period depict Garrido as Cort&eacute;s&#39;s page.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nIn his petition to the Spanish Crown, Garrido stated that he buried the Spanish dead when the fighting against the Aztecs ended. He also built a chapel at the site of the burials in 1521 and was recognized as the first person to plant wheat in Mexico. For these services, Garrido was granted a house-plot within the city and formally made a citizen. He was also appointed to government posts as doorman of the Mexico City council, guardian of the Chapultepec aqueduct, and town crier. All three positions carried salaries and afforded him a modest degree of status within the post-conquest society. In the late 1520s, Garrido married Francisca Ram&iacute;rez, a Spanish woman. The status of his spouse suggests that Garrido&rsquo;s attempts to improve his status and economic position were successful. The couple would have three children.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nThe late 1520s and 1530s saw Garrido try gold mining in the Mexican province of Zacatula and join Cort&eacute;s on an expedition to Baja California, but he returned to Mexico City by July 1536 without much success. Financial hardship drove Garrido to draft his royal petition asking for remuneration in 1538, and he would travel to Madrid to present it personally to the emperor. In the 1540s Garrido was involved in several legal cases to recover unpaid salary from his days as a doorkeeper. It appears that he died sometime between 1547 and 1550.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nGarrido&rsquo;s life represents the unpredictability of the conquest era. On one hand, he was able to escape slavery, fight against native empires, and even visit the court of Emperor Charles V. On the other hand, financial success and stability eluded Garrido (and many other conquistadors) as he moved from one conquest to the next.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.36887\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Jane Landers in the \\u003Cem\\u003EAfrican American National Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/kora.enslaved.org\\/files\\/16-23-101310\\/Juan_Garrido_AANB.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EView complete story (pdf)\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.74006\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Robert C.

Before he left for England in 1636, Thomas Key bound his daughter as a servant of Humphrey Higginson for a period of nine years. Sometime before 1655, perhaps because Higginson had died, Elizabeth Key came to be a ward of Colonel John Mottram, a justice of the peace in Northumberland County.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen Mottram died in 1655, Key sued for her freedom in the Northumberland County Court, arguing that she was a temporarily indentured servant, not a slave. Her lawyer, William Grinsted, argued that Key was a free English woman (inheriting this condition from her father) and Christian, and thus ineligible for enslavement. Furthermore, under the terms of her father&#39;s contract, Key&#39;s term of service had expired ten years earlier. In early 1655, &nbsp;a jury of twelve colonists ruled in Elizabeth&#39;s favor. Her freedom was short-lived, however, as the decision was overturned on appeal to the Virginia General Court. Grinsted in turn sought a hearing before the Virginia General Assembly. A specially appointed committee to handle the matter agreed with the original decision, enabling Key to regain her freedom. An appeal by the Mottram estate to the governor of Virginia in 1656 appears to have failed.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt is significant that Key&#39;s case divided Virginia&#39;s close-knit colonial political elite. Grinsted, her attorney, had also been engaged in an earlier legal dispute with the Mottrams and later married Key, suggesting that the Key case may have stemmed from existing tensions. For the Mottrams and the members of the general court, the Key case represented a direct challenge to the right of white Virginians to enslave all blacks. Legislation in the 1660s made it clear that the Mottrams&#39; view had become the prevailing one in Virginia, changing the status of a child to follow the mother and ensuring slaves would no longer gain their freedom on the grounds of Christian baptism. The Key case thus appears to have prompted Virginia lawmakers to tighten the state&#39;s legal codes and prevent future generations of Africans in the colony from achieving even the limited freedoms that she and other early black settlers had enjoyed.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.37291\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Steven J.

John had been freed by his master sometime before 1690. The elder Williams accumulated significant wealth through savvy business deals, leaving an estate worth &pound;12,000 sterling upon his death in 1723. Francis Williams was christened on December 26, 1697 in Spanish Town&rsquo;s (then Jamaica&rsquo;s capital) St. Catherine parish church.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAround 1710, Williams journeyed to Britain for an education. Accounts vary, but he certainly studied law at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, London, beginning in 1721. Williams apparently never finished a law degree and was back in Jamaica by the end of 1724, shortly after his father&rsquo;s death.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBack in Jamaica, Williams became a local celebrity, attracting fans and critics alike. He apparently sought a seat in the House of Assembly, but was rejected because of his ethnicity. Williams attended the governors&rsquo; receptions in wig and sword. In 1730, the Jamaica Assembly passed an act that, among other things, attempted to reduce William&rsquo;s privileged status to that of other free blacks by prohibiting him from bearing arms. Appealing to England, Williams won this case in 1732.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAround 1740, an anonymous portrait artist painted Williams dressed in grand style, wearing a ruffled silk shirt, waistcoat, long black velvet coat, breeches, and stockings. He is surrounded by books and globes to indicate his intellectual status. This style of life proved expensive and Williams apparently lacked the business skills of his father. He ran a school for black students, teaching reading, writing, Latin, and mathematics, but this was not lucrative. While Williams never formally married, one account indicates he treated one of his slaves as a wife and had children with her. To finance this lifestyle, Williams sold off inherited lands and slaves, and at his death in 1762, his estate had dwindled to just &pound;500 sterling, (most of the value coming from his sixteen slaves). He was buried in the churchyard of St. Catherine parish church in Spanish Town.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA Latin poem is the only confirmed example of Williams&rsquo;s literary output to survive. Contemporary comment on Williams came almost entirely from hostile whites who went out of their way to disparage his intellectual and literary achievements. Williams challenged everything they claimed about the inferiority and incapacity of black people, and their place in creation as mere drudges. Edward Long, the prominent pro-slavery planter who denied the humanity of black Africans, devoted a great deal of space in his&nbsp;\\u003Cem\\u003EHistory of Jamaica\\u003C\\/em\\u003E&nbsp;(1774) to Williams, including one of his poems. Perhaps the most celebrated reference came in the Scottish philosopher David Hume&rsquo;s infamous footnote M, in his essay &ldquo;Of National Characters,&rdquo; first published in&nbsp;1753&nbsp;but revised in&nbsp;1777&nbsp;to note that in Jamaica &ldquo;they talk of one negroe as a man of parts and learning; but &rsquo;tis likely he is admired for very slender accomplishments, like a parrot, who speaks a few words plainly.&rdquo;&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nWhile Williams never opposed the fundamentals of slave society, he openly challenged white dominance and advocated for the rights of free black people.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.75362\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by B.

He showed a talent for painting from an early age and began to study with Jo&atilde;o de Sousa, an established religious painter in Rio.

This was a major accomplishment for someone only 20 years old and still enslaved. Cunha&rsquo;s reputation as an artist grew, eventually reaching wealthy businessman Jos&eacute; Dias da Cruz. Cruz would serve as Cunha&rsquo;s main benefactor through the end of the eighteenth&nbsp;century.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn 1794, Cunha completed a commission for a series of paintings in the Novitiate Chapel of the Church of the Third Carmelite Order. Around the same time, he completed a series of portraits of benefactors for a charity, Holy House of Mercy. Following the completion of these commissions, Cruz, wishing to further Cunha&rsquo;s artistic education, paid for Cunha to study in the art academies of Lisbon. Cunha left for Lisbon around 1795, but it is unclear how long he stayed. Upon his return to Brazil, Cruz then purchased Cunha&rsquo;s freedom. Unencumbered by enslaved status, Cunha took on a wider range of commissions and established himself as a painting instructor, teaching twelve students in his home.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EContemporary scholars debate Cunha&rsquo;s classification as a member of the Fluminense School of painting, a grouping of late-eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century Rio artists.

Mar&iacute;a Chiquinquir&aacute; was the daughter of an African woman named Mar&iacute;a Antonia, a slave belonging to the wealthy, powerful Cepeda family. Before Mar&iacute;a Chiquinquir&aacute;&rsquo;s birth, Mar&iacute;a Antonia had become infected with leprosy. Expelled from the family house and abandoned, she died soon after Mar&iacute;a Chiquinquir&aacute;&rsquo;s birth.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen she was five, the patriarch of the Cepeda family reclaimed Mar&iacute;a Chinquinquir&aacute; as a slave. She ended up in the home of one of the sons, Presbyter Cepeda, where she joined a large group of slaves who worked outside the house. In exchange for their autonomy they gave the master a certain daily wage. This custom, very common during the colonial period in Spanish America, was called \\u003Cem\\u003Ejornal de esclavos\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (slaves&rsquo; daily wage), and in many cases it gave slaves the opportunity to be independent and accumulate some savings.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt some point, D&iacute;az married a skilled tailor, Jos&eacute; Espinosa, a freeborn \\u003Cem\\u003Epardo\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (black man) who lived in the same house. Together, they built a home and carried on a successful business. By the time their daughter Mar&iacute;a del Carmen was born, they were living &ldquo;as free persons.&rdquo; They lived as such until the presbyter suddenly reclaimed Mar&iacute;a del Carmen, now in her early teens, as a slave. By then, D&iacute;az&rsquo;s daughter was an educated young lady who had learned to read, write, and sew and the mother was determined to safeguard her daughter&rsquo;s freedom. She begged the presbyter to desist in his demand or negotiate prices for their freedom. As a last resort, she decided to sue the powerful priest.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn May 1794, Mar&iacute;a Chinquinquir&aacute; acted as a free woman and brought various charges against the Cepeda family. The legal argument put forward by the attorney in charge of her case was that once the owners of Mar&iacute;a Antonia abandoned her, she had acquired compulsory manumission and was considered freeborn. The judges of the colonial city council of Guayaquil decided against Mar&iacute;a Chinquinquir&aacute; and her daughter. However, she appealed to the royal court in Quito. Unfortunately, the final outcome remains unknown. Still, the case set in motion an effort to articulate a narrative of her own and her daughter&rsquo;s freedom based on witness testimony of those who knew them best.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.73800\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Mar\\u00eda Eugenia Chaves Maldonado in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\",\"Online Resources\":null,\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EChaves, Mar&iacute;a Eugenia. \\u003Cem\\u003EHonor y libertad: Discursos y recursos en las estrategias de libertad de una mujer esclava\\u003C\\/em\\u003E.

She self-identified as Lucum&iacute;, suggesting that her parents or other ancestors were Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; speakers from the interior of the Bight of Benin region of Africa. By the 1790s, a branch of the important Camejo family lived in Havana and worked in the tobacco trade. It was probably this family who owned Camejo as a domestic slave and gave her the surname.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESometime after the slave uprising on St. Domingue in 1791, Camejo married Juan Nepomuceno Prieto, an enslaved soldier in Havana&rsquo;s Battalion of Loyal Blacks.

Often, the cabildos blended traditional African practices with Christian ones. Between 1817 and 1835, Prieto (who was born into a Yoruba-speaking family in the Bight of Benin area) became the recognized head of the famous Mutual Aid Society of the Lucum&iacute; Nation of Santa B&aacute;rbara. Over 47,000 enslaved Lucum&iacute; arrived in Cuba from the Bight of Benin hinterland between 1817 and 1836, the majority of them Yoruba speakers, making the leadership positions in the institution very important. Alongside her husband, Camejo stood at the top of the ritual hierarchy. She likely administered schedules, kept track of the ritual family, organized purchases, received deliveries, booked musicians, prepared sacrificial offerings, directed ritual sequences, and controlled the organization&rsquo;s finances. The couple profited as entrepreneurs while also building up and helping to free members of the Lucum&iacute; community.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlthough Camejo and Prieto had no biological children, they raised a large religious family created through a system that combined secret initiations into the Lucum&iacute; religion with Catholic baptisms.

By 1777&nbsp;she had formed what would be a lifetime bond with an enslaved African-born man from a nearby plantation named Big Prince Whitten. Within two years, Judy and Prince had a son named Glasgow and a daughter named Polly.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the tumultuous period of the American Revolution, the Whitten family was seized and moved to Georgia by a loyalist commander. At the end of the war, neighboring Florida was returned to Spain, giving the Whittens new hope. After several failed attempts, they escaped across the St. Marys River into Florida in 1785.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETaking advantage of a religious sanctuary policy (shortly before it ended in 1790), the Whittens and other escaped slaves stated that they fled to Florida to become Catholics and were accepted into the colony as free subjects of the Spanish Crown. All the Whittens were baptized. Judy became Mar&iacute;a Rafaela, Prince took the name Juan Bautista, and the children became Domingo and Mar&iacute;a Francisca.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Whittens quickly took full advantage of their new rights as free Spanish subjects. Mar&iacute;a raised pigs for sale and trained young black girls to be domestics, and the family used the legal system to protect their rights. For example, Prince sued successfully in 1789 for breach of contract when Mar&iacute;a&rsquo;s employer forced her to do heavy field work rather than the contracted domestic service. The Whittens&rsquo; economic successes and 1798 marriage in the Catholic church helped improve their social status. Also in 1798, Mar&iacute;a litigated in her own name over physical assault. She sued a white family and asserted that her status and honor as a citizen (she used this term rather than more common descriptors that would mark her as black or a freed person) was at stake. Whitten&rsquo;s status continued to rise, evidenced by her serving as a godmother for at least thirty-one individuals (members of the local black community).\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe family migrated again after Spain sold Florida to the United States in 1821.

Early in her life, Njinga exhibited great physical prowess, which her father fostered by allowing her to train with the army. Displaying extraordinary charisma and physical prowess at a young age, he also groomed her for leadership, allowing her to sit in court sessions alongside him at a young age. This training was essential since, throughout her childhood, Portuguese forces attempted to invade Ndongo and enslaved hundreds of thousands of Ndongo&rsquo;s subjects. Those who were taken by the Portuguese either labored in Portuguese Angola or were absorbed into the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen Mbande a Ngola died (ca. 1617), his son Ngola Mbandi became king. Between 1619 and 1621, the kingdom of Ndongo faced increasing pressure from the colony of Angola, as Portuguese-led forces attacked under the leadership of Governor Luis Mendes de Vasconcelos, forcing Mbandi to move his kingdom to the Kidonga Islands. Mbandi sent Njinga, then 22, to Luanda to negotiate a peace treaty with the Portuguese. During this trip, Njinga made a huge impression on Jo&atilde;o Correa de Sousa, the governor of Luanda, when she refused to sit on the floor before him as was the custom for Africans. Instead, Njinga commanded one of her servants to kneel on all fours and sat on the servant as a human chair. She also agreed to be baptized during this trip, perhaps to garner favor with the colonialists, taking the Christian name Ana de Sousa. Njinga and de Sousa negotiated a peace treaty in which the Portuguese agreed to withdraw their forces and assist Ndongo in pushing back mercenaries attacking the kingdom.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis peace was short-lived as relations between Ndongo and the Portuguese deteriorated. Njinga&rsquo;s brother, the king Ngola Mbandi, committed suicide in 1622, leaving Njinga in charge as regent for his young son; she became queen in 1624 when Mbandi&rsquo;s heir was killed, reportedly by Njinga herself. From the time she took the throne in 1624 until her death in 1663, Njinga continued to negotiate with Portuguese authorities, although these attempts were largely unsuccessful. In the late 1620s, the Portuguese sided with dissidents of Ndongo who rejected Njinga&rsquo;s claim to the throne, instead promoting Hari a Ngola, a rival leader who challenged Njinga rights to the throne. This move by the Portuguese resulted in prolonged conflicts between Njinga and the Portuguese and their local allies.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlthough she struggled to regain her hold over Ndongo, Njinga conquered the neighboring kingdoms of Kidonga and Matamba in the mid-1630s. She entered into a partnership with the Dutch West India Company following their occupation of Luanda in 1641, utilizing this alliance to fend off conflict with the Portuguese. With Dutch help?, Njinga defeated the Portuguese army that attacked her capital in Matamba in 1644. Although Njinga&rsquo;s forces and the Dutch held off the Portuguese from 1641- to 1648, the Portuguese ultimately regained their hold following the arrival of reinforcements from Brazil and pushed Njinga back to Matamba. After negotiations, the Portuguese eventually signed a peace treaty with Njinga in 1657 which recognized her claim to rule, delineated the territory under her control, agreed to disband the Imbangala (warrior founders of the Kasanje Kingdom), and stipulated that she would allow missionaries into her territory. Njinga spent the remainder of her reign arranging for her succession and defending her kingdom against the Imbangala of Kasanje to the east. Following her death on December 17, 1663, her sister Barbara succeeded to the throne.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENjinga quickly gained notoriety amongst Portuguese onlookers, both for her ferocious stance against the imposition of Portuguese colonialism as well as her fierce rejection of gendered norms. Njinga&rsquo;s sexuality scandalized the Portuguese, as she kept both male and female concubines, married multiple husbands, dressed as a man and insisted on being referred to as king and not queen. Njinga also gained notoriety during this period for her involvement in the slave trade. As a result of the conflicts during her reign, Njinga&rsquo;s forces took hundreds of thousands of captives, allowing the queen to sell nearly 200,000 slaves to the Portuguese. Njinga&rsquo;s memory is preserved in the traditions of black Brazilians and Afro-Portuguese descendants worldwide. In particular, Njinga is remembered among Afro-Brazilians descended in part from Angolan slaves who each year celebrate her legend by electing a King of Kongo and a Queen Njinga each year, and dedicating floats and sing praises to her during the Rio Carnival. In 2013, the Angolan government commemorated the 350th anniversary of Njinga&rsquo;s death by erecting a statue in her honor in Luanda.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.74658\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Nicolette M.

She preached to crowds and prophesied the future. This behavior led to her veneration as a saint, even by her own master and his family. She renamed herself Rosa Maria Egipc&iacute;aca da Vera Cruz, a name inspired by the famous Egyptian saint, another former prostitute. Presumably, in response to her growing influence over the local Catholic laity, the bishop of Mariana had Rosa severely flogged, resulting in partial paralysis of her right side. After this ordeal, Father Lopes bought and freed her.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe pair moved to Rio de Janeiro, where Rosa&rsquo;s visions and ecstatic experiences grew more frequent and elaborate, impressing the Franciscan monks and prompting talk of her becoming a model of saintliness for Afro descendants in the empire. During this time, she learned to read and write, thus becoming the first African in Brazil known to not only learn the alphabet but also to have written a book, \\u003Ci\\u003EThe Sacred Theology of Love of God Brilliant Light of Pilgrim Souls,\\u003C\\/i\\u003E of which only six of 290 pages have survived. Rosa also founded the Retreat of Our Lady of Labor for former prostitutes, most of whom were either black or multiracial. Her writings and proclamations made Rosa the main Brazilian exponent of a cult dedicated to worshipping the hearts of Saint Joseph and Christ&rsquo;s grandparents. Soon, she amassed a core group of followers who began worshipping her person.

However, existing information suggests that she stayed on in the household of the Inquisition, working in the kitchen as a servant, where she was found dead on October 12, 1771.

Her narrative describes a happy childhood, interrupted when she was captured by European slave raiders who came to her village when she was about twelve. They marched her to the coast, where she was taken across the Atlantic with approximately 300 other slaves. Belinda was purchased by a wealthy Caribbean planter, Isaac Royall, Jr. Belinda first worked for the family on their Antigua plantation, before Royall brought her and other enslaved people&nbsp;to his home in Medford, Massachusetts.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ERoyall, the colony&rsquo;s largest slaveholder, was a loyalist who fled to England at the outset of the American Revolution.

Royall also left money to establish the first professorship in law at Harvard College. Belinda was illiterate, and historians have speculated that the famous African American activist Prince Hall may have drafted the petition on her behalf. The legislature granted Belinda fifteen pounds and twelve shillings annually, which Belinda repeatedly petitioned to collect. She disappears from the historical record after her last petition in 1793, apparently having died by 1799.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhile this last extension marks Belinda&rsquo;s final appearance in the historical record, her petition became an abolitionist tool on both sides of the Atlantic, solidifying her legacy. Both the initial petition and a dramatized, first-person version circulated in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Although portrayed and deployed as a petition for freedom, Belinda was in fact one of the first claimants for reparations for unpaid labor, an important step in the continued reckoning with the legacies of slavery.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.35457\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Roy E.

She was particularly prone to expressing her rage against prisoners taken by the resistance fighters. Solitude kept rabbits and once caught one that escaped, speared it with a skewer, and showed it to the prisoners, saying &ldquo;Look, this is how I&rsquo;m going to treat you when the time comes.&rdquo;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOn May 22, 1802, a furious attack forced the black resistance troops in Fort Saint-Charles to retreat.

However, because of her pregnancy, Solitude&rsquo;s execution was delayed until she gave birth. On November 29, 1802, the day after she delivered her child, Solitude was hanged.

He was from the Yoruba ethnic group that stretches from southwest Nigeria into Benin. He was the second child of his father, Oluale, and his second wife, Nyfond-lo-loo. He was one of twelve children by two different wives. As a child&nbsp;Kossola enjoyed playing the drums. As a young man he began training to become a soldier, which according to him was for defensive purposes only. He was initiated into the oro, the secret all-male Yoruba society in charge of protecting the community. At the time of his enslavement at the age of 19, he was in the process of courting a young woman.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EKossola was captured in February 1860, alongside 109 others in a raid by the Kingdom of Dahomey. While the trans-Atlantic slave trade was officially abolished, it still continued. The Dahomean King Ghezo, who ruled Dahomey from 1818 to 1856, signed a treaty with Great Britain in 1852 agreeing to stop his involvement in the slave trade. However, he continued the trade clandestinely.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGhezo&rsquo;s son Badohun, known as King Glele, attacked Kossola&rsquo;s town because it refused to pay tribute to Dahomey. According to Kossola, he and the other slaves were marched to the coast and then held in the coastal port of Ouidah for three weeks in a slave pen, also known as a barracoon. He was sold for $100 to Timothy Meaher, a shipbuilder who owned lumber mills and cotton plantations in Alabama.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMeaher transported Kossola and the 109 other slaves on the \\u003Cem\\u003EClotilda\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, a ship he built from his own wood and burned upon its return to hide the evidence. The journey to the port of Mobile, Alabama, took about forty-five days. Upon arrival, he was given to Meaher&rsquo;s brother James. When James Meaher could not say &ldquo;Kossola,&rdquo; Kossola said to try instead &ldquo;Cudjo,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;born on a Monday.&rdquo; Since his family name was Oluale, he adopted Lewis.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAfter the abolition of slavery following the Civil War, Lewis and other former slaves organized the community of Africantown in 1868. Lewis asked Timothy Meaher for land to build the community, and he refused. For several years they rented the land, and in 1872 Lewis purchased two acres from Meaher for $100.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAfter gaining his freedom, Lewis married Abile, a woman who had been on the slave ship \\u003Cem\\u003EClotilda\\u003C\\/em\\u003E with him. They were together on James Meaher&rsquo;s plantation. Together they had six children: Aleck, James, Pollee Dahoo, David, Cudjo, and Celia Es-bew-O-see).\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlongside most of his fellow shipmates, Lewis worked in Timothy Meaher&rsquo;s lumberyards for one dollar a day. Additionally, he farmed to grow enough food for his family&rsquo;s consumption. Lewis became a famed storyteller in Africantown, and told stories of his homeland back in Benin. He continued to practice Yoruba religious beliefs, while also joining Mobile&rsquo;s Stone Street Baptist Church. In 1872, he helped found the Old Baptist Church (later renamed the Union Baptist Church).In November 1908, his beloved Abile died after forty years of marriage. Lewis continued to tell stories of his homeland, and was interviewed repeatedly by Zora Neale Hurston over the end of 1927 and the first few months of 1928. Lewis survived until 1935 when he died well into his nineties.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn 1959, a bust of Lewis was placed in front of Union Baptist Church, and in 1977 a bronze plaque was placed in Mobile&rsquo;s Bienville Square to honor both Lewis and Africantown.

The book had been completed but rejected by publishers in 1931 due to its discussion of Africans&rsquo; involvement in the slave trade, as well as the use of African American vernacular.

The Caribs left no written records, so tales of their lives and struggles with&nbsp;European colonizers came from their enemies. There is no doubt from the surviving accounts that colonial officials regarded Chatoyer as a pivotal figure who obstructed their goal of acquiring land for the cultivation of sugarcane. Early nineteenth-century historian Charles Shephard described Chatoyer as &ldquo;ruthless and sanguinary&rdquo; and possessing &ldquo;cruelty rather than courage.&rdquo; Sir William Young, a British colonial official, attached a great deal of importance to Chatoyer. Young&#39;s son, also Sir William, the author and heir to his father&rsquo;s estate, took note of the hospitality that his father showed to Chatoyer, the Carib chief, who on occasion enjoyed dining and accommodation at his villa and on his properties. The elder Young also apparently invited Italian painter Antonio Brunias to St. Vincent, who painted the only surviving depiction of Chatoyer.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EChatoyer first appeared in the historical records in 1768 as chief of the Grand Sable estate where &nbsp;he led Carib resistance to British surveys of their land, a step towards occupation of those lands. Chatoyer was a military strategist and diplomat who appeared to have well understood the geopolitics of those times. He played on French&ndash;British antagonisms to seek French assistance in the struggle against the British. During fighting between the two imperial powers in 1778-9 (part of the American Revolution), Chatoyer played a leading role coordinating the joint efforts of the French and Caribs. He was also a key diplomat in the negotiations over Saint Vincent at the subsequent Treaty of Paris (1783).\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EChatoyer died in 1795 in another struggle against the British remembered as the Second Carib War.

She was known early in life as Justine Fervin and received no formal education. At some point, Fervin was brought to New Orleans, eventually securing her freedom and calling herself Marie. By the 1820s she was living in the Faubourg Marigny district and had married a free black carpenter named Gabriel Bernard Couvent.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ECouvent and her husband regularly attended mass at St. Louis Cathedral, where she established a friendship with Constantine Manehault, a priest who was to become her religious director. With no children to support, the Couvents lived comfortably and amassed substantial savings. They owned several properties around the city and a small number of slaves.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen Gabriel died in 1829, he left his considerable estate to Marie. On the advice of Father Manehault, she decided to use this wealth to establish a Catholic school for poor free-born orphans of color. In 1832, Couvent dictated a will, leaving her property at Grand Hommes (Dauphine) and Union (Touro) Streets to serve as school buildings for orphans of color in the Faubourg Marigny district. She further specified that Father Manehault should direct the school.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ECouvent died in New Orleans five years later. Henry Fletcher, a free man of color, was named executor of her will. However, over the next few years he appeared uninterested in fulfilling those duties and the city showed no interest. After more than a decade of delays, Father Manehault decided the project could wait no longer and with the help of prominent New Orleans citizen Fran&ccedil;ois Lacroix assembled a lobbying group known as the Society for the Instruction of Indigent Orphans to pressure Fletcher and the city into action. Within months, the &Eacute;cole des Orphelins de Couleur was opened.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEstablishing a school for indigent people of color was a pioneering feat in antebellum Louisiana, where public and most private schools were restricted to white children. The school instructed students in English and French and also offered special Spanish courses. The Couvent School&rsquo;s fortune waxed and waned after opening, surviving mostly on donations from wealthy parents and successful black locals. It boasted notable staff and alumni, including its principal Arman Lanusse, the first African American to compile an anthology of poetry, and alumnus Ernest N. Morial, the first African American mayor of New Orleans. The school operated under various names while keeping its same purpose until Hurricane Katrina forced its closure in 2006.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.35548\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Richard J.

His parents were Colonel Henry Bannerman, a Scottish trader and officer, and a Ga woman from Accra whose name is unknown. Henry Bannerman worked for the Royal Africa Company and was stationed at Cape Coast, a British fort on the Atlantic Ocean in what is today Ghana. His mother&rsquo;s family was connected to nearby chieftaincies. These dual connections gave Bannerman the ability to work as a middleman between West Africans and the British.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ELittle is known about Bannerman&rsquo;s childhood. In 1826, Bannerman married Yaa Hom, an Asante princess who had been captured when the British defeated the Kingdom of Asante at the Battle of Katamonso in 1826. At the time, Asante was the dominant state in the region. Bannerman and Yaa Hom eventually had six children together.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBannerman was a prosperous slave owner and clashed with the British over the abolition of slavery in Cape Coast. He believed that he had a right to manage and maintain his &ldquo;property&rdquo; as he saw fit. In 1841, he wrote the British Parliament warning that the abolition of slavery would lead to a flight of Ghanaians away from British territory.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBannerman benefited from the growing trade between Cape Coast and Europe. As a prosperous land and slave owner with connections both to the British and the Asante, he was well positioned to be of service to foreign businesses and local kingdoms. After a long trading career, Bannerman entered the British colonial administration as a justice of the peace in 1842. By 1850, he became the lieutenant governor of the Gold Coast (today Ghana). He also served as an unofficial member of the Gold Coast Legislative Council.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDuring his time as lieutenant governor, he was involved in many important events. Most notably, he came to the defense of Thomas Birch Freeman, an Afro-English missionary who was attacked by priests of a local deity named Naanam Mpow. Bannerman responded by jailing the priests. While he had higher ambitions, he was never able to become governor of the Gold Coast.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBannerman&rsquo;s family remained prominent after his death in 1858. His son Charles established the \\u003Cem\\u003EAccra Herald\\u003C\\/em\\u003E newspaper in September 1857, the first African to publish a newspaper in West Africa. The \\u003Cem\\u003EAccra Herald\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (later named the \\u003Cem\\u003EWest African Herald\\u003C\\/em\\u003E) continued for 16 years. Another son, Edmund, served as secretary to governors of the Gold Coast, a Civil Commandant, and a Justice of the Peace. He later became an attorney. Bannerman&rsquo;s sons were all educated in England.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBannerman&rsquo;s grandson, Thomas Hutton-Mills Sr., was a lawyer and nationalist leader in the early twentieth century. He served as the first President of the National Congress of British West Africa in 1920. Thomas Hutton-Mills Jr., was a lawyer and early member of Kwame Nkrumah&rsquo;s Convention People&rsquo;s Party (CPP). He was put in jail in 1950 for helping lead boycotts and strikes against the British.

After attending a Koranic school and training to be a merchant, Baquaqua was kidnapped around age twenty-one, sold into slavery, and shipped to Brazil.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn Brazil, Baquaqua was initially sold to a baker in Pernambuco. When he refused to comply, he was sent south to Rio de Janeiro and sold to a ship&rsquo;s captain. Baquaqua served as the cabin steward on the \\u003Cem\\u003ELembran&ccedil;a\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, a ship that made two trips to southern Brazil before sailing from Rio to deliver a consignment of coffee in New York. There, Baquaqua became the object of a legal dispute between local abolitionists who helped him jump ship, and his Brazilian master who attempted to recover him. When two judges refused to free Baquaqua, his abolitionist supporters helped him to escape from jail and make his way to Boston via the Underground Railroad. From Boston he was sent to Haiti to avoid being arrested again.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the free black republic of Haiti, Baquaqua once again faced the difficulty of adapting to another culture and language. The Reverend William Judd and his wife Nancy of the American Baptist Free Mission Society soon took him into their home. There, he worked as their cook and learned English, becoming proficient enough to read the Bible and write letters. He also converted to Christianity and was baptized in 1848.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAfter two years in Haiti, Baquaqua was in danger of being drafted into the Haitian army. He returned instead to New York to continue his education, hoping to work as a missionary in Africa. With the support of abolitionists, he secured funding and studied for three years at New York Central College in upstate New York. After leaving school in 1853, he traveled throughout New York and Pennsylvania, fundraising for the Free Baptist missions. Baquaqua drew on his own experiences as a slave to become an effective abolitionist speaker in spite of his heavily accented English.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ERacist attacks and threats prompted Baquaqua to move to Chatham, Ontario, Canada in 1854. He crossed the border to nearby Detroit in order to arrange publication of his biography under his own copyright. Shortly thereafter, Baquaqua left for Liverpool, England, planning to return to West Africa. However, he encountered many difficulties in securing funding and was still in England as of 1857, the last date in which he appears in the historical record. How and where he died, and whether he married and had a family are unknown today.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlthough he may never have reached Africa, Baquaqua&rsquo;s biography survives to document his resistance to enslavement, as well as his unique journey from bondage in Africa and Brazil to freedom in New York and England. His biography is valuable as one of the most detailed and fully authenticated accounts of Africa and the Atlantic crossing on a slave ship. Baquaqua is also notable for making the cultural transition from being a Dendi-speaking Muslim, who had studied at a Qur&rsquo;anic school and knew some Arabic, to a Portuguese-speaking slave in Brazil, then to a free Baptist convert in Creole-speaking Haiti, and finally to an English-speaking abolitionist in North America and England.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.36138\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Paul E.

Today, she is a symbol of resistance and defiance for Afro-Brazilian social movements. Much of what little is known about her derives from brief biographical notes and a poem written by her son Luiz Gama (1830&ndash;82). This information is largely uncorroborated.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGama described his mother as a thin, hard-working, and attractive Nag&ocirc; (a Yorub&aacute; speaking group) from the Gold Coast area of West Africa. He argues that Luiza was proud and combative, always refused the Christian faith, and was imprisoned several times for participating in slave-led revolts and conspiracies that took place in the Bahia province in the early nineteenth century. Gama suggested that the Brazilian government deported Mahin to Rio de Janeiro and possibly on to Africa in the crackdown following the abolitionist Sabinada Revolt (1837&ndash;38).\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EScholars have emphasized Mahin&rsquo;s central role in the 1835 Muslim-led slave rebellion known as the Mal&ecirc; Revolt. By working as a \\u003Cem\\u003Equitandeira\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (street vendor of snacks) in Salvador, Mahin earned enough money to purchase her freedom, and later came to be a key agent in the uprising. Her \\u003Cem\\u003Etabuleiro\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (food stand) and house were strategic meeting points for the conspirators. A common narrative circulated that Mahin would be declared Queen of Brazil after the uprising.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EContemporary historians are skeptical about the historical plausibility of a supposedly &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; woman having a central role in a movement composed mostly of Muslim men. Instead, Jo&atilde;o Jos&eacute; Reis suggests that Mahin&rsquo;s protagonism in the Mal&ecirc; Revolt was initially popularized through clashing portrayals of her in the works of twentieth-century intellectuals. Her designation as an Afro-Brazilian leader was further advanced during the reorganization of the Afro-Brazilian movement during the late 1970s. Afro-Brazilians and feminists challenged the idea of a Brazilian &ldquo;racial democracy,&rdquo; virtually free from racism. They celebrated figures like Mahin who countered dominant stereotypes about Afro-Brazilians. Being simultaneously a slave who revolted against the slavery system, a woman who showed leadership among men, a pagan who defied Christianization, a humble yet politically ambitious street vendor, and the mother of one of Brazil&rsquo;s most famous abolitionists, Mahin was an ideal role model.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBeyond unanswered questions about the historical accuracy of Mahin&rsquo;s life, including the conditions of her death, she remains a symbol of defiance and inspiration for Brazilians in general and for Afro-Brazilian feminists in particular.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.74429\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Genaro Vilanova Miranda de Oliveira in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\",\"Online Resources\":null,\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp xmlns=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.w3.org\\/1999\\/html\\\"\\u003Ede Oliveira, Genaro Vilanova Miranda. &quot;Mahin, Luiza.&quot;&nbsp;\\u003Cem\\u003EDictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography&nbsp;\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, edited by Ed.

His father was a wealthy Portuguese miner and his mother was a Yoruba-speaking West African slave. Rather than performing manual labor like most slaves, he learned to read and write and helped to manage his father&rsquo;s estate. Along with his seven siblings, Costa was declared free and named an heir in his father&rsquo;s will.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EManumission came at his father&rsquo;s death in 1760. Two days prior, Costa had purchased his father&rsquo;s entire estate (including mining plots, farms, townhouses, and 391 slaves) in partnership with his godfather. This was a common strategy families in colonial Brazil used to avoid property losses caused by a member&rsquo;s death.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBetween 1760 and 1796, Costa invested in cattle ranches and African slaves to diversify and maintain the productivity of his fortune. The size and value of his estate at the time of his death attests to the success of his efforts and is representative of the shift away from gold mining and toward slave-based production of foodstuff for internal markets in late colonial Minas Gerais.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ECosta was appointed captain and later field commander of the pardo militia of Sabar&aacute;. The militias were expanded in 1766 from white men only to include pardos (colored men) and pretos (blacks), resulting in regiments organized by these categories. In 1780 the governor of Minas Gerais began appointing field commanders to each regiment. Costa&rsquo;s nomination as field commander signaled his prominence in local society. The crown&rsquo;s confirmation of his rank, moreover, allowed him to enjoy privileges and some of the prestige reserved for the officer class.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnt&ocirc;nio Vieira da Costa died with no appointed heirs in 1796. He was a wealthy man, the owner of plots of land, mining sites, three large farms, three cattle ranches, and 143 slaves. Costa had also been a central figure within a social circle of free and freed persons of African descent. His wealth and influence, however, did not exempt him from being categorized by his ancestry and skin color. When he was appointed to the highest rank within the local militia, Costa&rsquo;s authority extended only to those who shared his mixed African and European ancestry. His economic success, while extraordinary for a freed slave, did not challenge the institutional and social categories that framed hierarchical relationships in colonial Brazil.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.73710\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Mariana Dantas in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Online Resources\":null,\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EBergad, Laird. \\u003Cem\\u003ESlavery and the Demographic and Economic History of Minas Gerais, Brazil, 1720&ndash;1888\\u003C\\/em\\u003E.

Joanna was the second of the couple&rsquo;s five children. Her mother tongue was Sranan, the Creole language spoken by the slaves, but her father also taught her to speak Dutch. Kruythoff also taught Joanna how to read and write. Seerie, however, refused to baptize all of her children and remained kept faith in&nbsp;Afro-Surinamese gods.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn 1768, Kruythoff tried to purchase Seerie and her children from the new plantation owner. He became ill soon after and drew up a will ordering his executor to arrange for emancipation for all of them.

He died soon after.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBy early 1772, the plantation foundered under the punitive regime of the new manager and all of the Fauquembergue slaves (including Joanna and her family) were rented out to local families in Paramaribo, the capital. In April 1773, Seerie arranged a place for Joanna with Captain John Gabriel Stedman who had recently arrived from the Netherlands to fight a Maroon group. Joanna would keep house and serve as &ldquo;wife&rdquo; to Stedman in return for payment to her owner and a small fee to Seerie.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EStedman interspersed his military expeditions with living with Joanna and their son, Johnny, born in November 1774.

Unable (or perhaps unwilling) to complete the purchase a year later, Stedman managed to obtain Johnny&rsquo;s freedom but left mother and son with his creditor before he departed for the Dutch Republic in April 1777.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EJoanna lived on in Paramaribo, serving Stedman&rsquo;s creditor, Mrs. Godefroy. She died still enslaved in November 1782. In 1784, Johnny was sent to live with his father. Stedman&rsquo;s journal reveals that Johnny grew up with much affection from his father, but that he drowned as a young sailor on an English frigate. Stedman&rsquo;s thoughts circled around his Suriname years for the rest of his life, culminating in the 1796 publication of his \\u003Cem\\u003ENarrative of a Five Years&rsquo; Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, illustrated by William Blake. The narrative included a sentimental tale of his intimacy with Joanna, noting her beauty and virtues.

As a young child she was abducted by a slave merchant and transported to Brazil. Albina&rsquo;s chest carried a customary hot-iron brand in the form of an &ldquo;I,&rdquo; confirming her Luanda origins. The ship that carried her across the Atlantic was captured under antislavery measures intended to suppress the then-illegal trans-Atlantic slave trade.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESent on to Rio de Janeiro, Albina was delivered to the lieutenant and engineer Pedro Bandeira de Gouveia, who was expected to educate her as a domestic servant. At that time, liberated Africans like Albina were compelled to remain in Brazil to learn Portuguese and the Christian religion. They were to work under the protection or custody of the state or free persons, under the promise of a future life as free people. Full emancipation almost never happened.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlbina traveled with Gouveia&rsquo;s family to Bel&eacute;m, capital of Par&aacute; province, where she was placed in the custody of provincial president Dr. Fausto Augusto de Aguiar. Custody of Albina was then ceded to the family of the physician and politician, Joaquim Frutuoso Pereira Guimar&atilde;es. Mariana Pimenta Cabedo, Guimar&atilde;es&rsquo;s widow, treated Albina as a slave and sold her to Ign&aacute;cia Bucheira, who later sold her to Anna Fillipa, who in turn sold her to Tiburcio. Albina eventually came to be owned by Antonio Joaquim Nogueira, who sold her again to Jos&eacute; dos Santos. Finally, Santos resold Albina to Jos&eacute; Soares da Silva Pimentel, owner of a soap factory in Bel&eacute;m.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn 1876, Albina went before the judicial system to demand her freedom. Several free people helped her, including Jose Maria de S&aacute; Lamego, who used the local press to report the story of Albina&rsquo;s illegal bondage. He also took the case to the provincial president and police authorities without much success. Finally, the Portuguese consul offered help. Albina was technically a Portuguese citizen, having been born in a Portuguese colony. Once the legal process to achieve freedom had started, her last owner agreed to establish a price for manumission.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlthough her bondage was illegal, paying the price for freedom avoided a protracted lawsuit that carried with it no guarantees for success. A record of the result of Albina&rsquo;s struggle for freedom and when she died does not survive. Nonetheless, her life is representative of the many Africans who struggled against illegal enslavement in nineteenth-century Brazil.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.73679\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Jos&eacute; Maia Bezerra Neto in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\",\"Online Resources\":null,\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EBezerra Neto, Jos&eacute; Maia.\\u003Cem\\u003E Escravid&atilde;o negra no Gr&atilde;o-Par&aacute; (s&eacute;cs.

She was probably born in central Missouri around 1836 and purchased by farmer Robert Newsom in Audrain County around 1850. Celia became the cook and only female slave in the Newsom household in neighboring Calloway County.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EAt some point on the return journey from Audrain County, seventy-year-old Newsom raped 14 year old&nbsp; Celia. It immediately became apparent to Celia, however, that Robert Newsom had purchased her primarily to serve as his concubine. Perhaps to keep his liaison secret from his daughters Virginia and Mary, but certainly to provide easy access to his concubine, Newsom provided Celia with her own cabin, a relatively spacious and solid brick structure located a mere sixty paces from his own home. Newsom may have also deliberately separated Celia, the only black woman on the Newsom farm, from her fellow slaves to prevent her from forming friendships or alliances with them. Court records show that over the next four years the rapes continued, and that Newsom repeatedly forced Celia to have sex with him against her will. He fathered one or both of the children born to Celia between 1851 and 1854. After the birth of her second child, she began a sexual relationship with George, another of Newsom&#39;s slaves. When Celia became pregnant again in March 1855, she did not know which man was the father. George then demanded that she abandon Newsom.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ESometime around June 23, 1855 Celia, who had been poorly throughout her pregnancy, begged Newsom to leave her alone. When he instead returned to her cabin and demanded sex that night, she resisted his advances and struck him twice with a stick. Upon discovering that Newsom was dead, Celia attempted to cover up the crime. Newsom&rsquo;s daughters roused a search party of neighbors. Fearing for his own life, George told the leader that he had last seen Newsom heading towards Celia&#39;s cabin. Under threat of having her children taken away, Celia eventually confessed to the murder.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ECelia was indicted for Newsom&#39;s murder on June 25, 1855. The hearings took place during a period of growing national and local divisions about slavery. Missouri law did not allow slaves to testify on their own behalf, but the court did provide Celia with counsel. The man chosen was John Jameson, a respected and experienced trial lawyer. Jameson argued that the killing was necessary in self-defense and that the criminal laws of Missouri made no distinction by race. He quoted a section that stated simply &ldquo;homicide shall be deemed justifiable when committed by any person resisting&rdquo; a felony such as rape. Jameson also hoped to earn sympathy for his client by informing the court of Newsom&#39;s history of forced sexual assaults on Celia. At some point during Celia&#39;s incarceration and trial, she gave birth to a stillborn child.&nbsp;&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EIn spite of Jameson&#39;s efforts, trial judge William Hall advised the all-white jury that they could not acquit Celia on the grounds of self-defense, and all but instructed them to find her guilty of murder in the first degree. They did so on October 10, 1855 and three days later Judge Hall sentenced her to death on November 16. Five days before her scheduled execution date, however, she and another slave on death row escaped from the Callaway County jail, but were subsequently recaptured. The historian Melton McLaurin has speculated that Celia&#39;s attorneys may have aided her escape in order to force the Missouri Supreme Court to hear her appeal. On 14 December 1855 the court unanimously rejected the defense appeal for a stay of execution.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EInterrogated on the eve of her execution Celia continued to insist that she had acted alone and that she had not intended to kill Newsom that night. Pregnant, ill, and having suffered from Newsom&#39;s abuse for more than five years, something inside her had simply snapped. &ldquo;As soon as I struck him,&rdquo; she confessed, &ldquo;the Devil got into me, and I struck [Newsom] with the stick until he was dead, and then rolled him in the fire and burnt him up&rdquo; (McLaurin, 114). Celia, still only nineteen years of age, was executed by hanging on 21 December 1855. Her case, according to the legal historian and federal judge A. Leon Higginbotham , was even more &ldquo;venal and racist&rdquo; than the more famous Missouri slave case, Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857). Unlike Scott, who was ultimately freed and who died of natural causes, Higginbotham argues, Celia was executed because the Missouri courts held that &ldquo;a slave woman had no virtue that the law would protect against a master&#39;s lust&rdquo; (Higginbotham, 694).\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.35516\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Steven J.

It was only when the ship began to depart that the abandoned Gama realized what had happened and shouted desperately to his father, who stood on the pier below, &ldquo;Father, you have sold me!&rdquo; Since Gama had been born to a free woman, this enslavement was illegal.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUpon arriving in the capital of the Brazilian empire, Gama was sold twice and then put up for sale in several interior slave markets but never purchased because of his Bahian origin. Slaveholders were very leery of purchasing Bahian slaves as a result of the recent uprisings there. Gama was taken instead to the home of slave trader Ant&ocirc;nio Pereira Cardoso in S&atilde;o Paulo, where he worked as a houseboy for eight years. In 1847 Ant&ocirc;nio Rodrigues do Prado, a law student, came to live in Cardoso&rsquo;s home. Prado taught Gama how to read and write and inspired in him an interest in the law. In 1848 Gama escaped from Cardoso&rsquo;s home after obtaining documents proving the illegality of his enslavement.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGama next joined the army and served on the police force for a period of six years. He also worked part-time as a clerk in the law office of Francisco Mariade Sousa Furtado de Mendon&ccedil;a, a high-ranking police official and later professor who taught Gama literature and the basics of law.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAfter leaving the military in 1854 Gama was eventually hired as a clerk in the S&atilde;o Paulo police department&rsquo;s headquarters. Meanwhile, he fell in love with Claudina Fortunata de Sampaio. The couple married and had a son. Gama&rsquo;s police salary enabled him to devote his free time to exploring social issues and to publishing poetry and newspaper articles. His firm anti-slavery stance drew criticism and threats from conservative abolitionists and slaveholders alike and resulted in his being fired from his job. However, Gama soon landed on his feet with several jobs in newspaper editing.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EShifting his anti-slavery efforts to the courts, Gama trained himself and used his extensive legal knowledge to defend people who had been illegally enslaved. He also purchased the freedom of several slaves with donations he received from his antislavery speeches. Gama even used his own home in S&atilde;o Paulo as a place of refuge for fugitive slaves. Through his efforts he became known as the &ldquo;lawyer of the slaves,&rdquo; freeing more than five hundred people.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe ardent abolitionist died from complications of diabetes in his home in S&atilde;o Paulo on August 24, 1882. His dream of freedom for all slaves was realized six years later in 1888.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.73991\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Lamonte Aidoo in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\",\"Online Resources\":null,\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp xmlns=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.w3.org\\/1999\\/html\\\"\\u003EAidoo, Lamonte. &quot;Gama, Luiz Gonzaga Pinto da.&quot;&nbsp;\\u003Cem\\u003EDictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography&nbsp;\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, edited by Ed.

He was probably enslaved during military incursions into Dahomey by the kingdom of Oyo and brought to Brazil around 1800. After years as a wage-earning slave (\\u003Cem\\u003Eescravo de ganho\\u003C\\/em\\u003E), de Jesus was able to buy his freedom in 1810. As a freedman, he adopted his master&rsquo;s name and also copied his strategies to build a prosperous career in slave trading and money lending from his base in the port of Salvador de Bahia. By 1835, he owned eight houses and sixteen slaves.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAccused of collaborating in the 1835 slave and Muslim-led Mal&ecirc; Revolt in Salvador da Bahia, de Jesus was deported to Africa and forced to abandon all properties in Brazil.

He sent &nbsp;some of his slaves back to Bahia as correspondents and in an 1836 petition to the Bahia provincial assembly, he appealed on the grounds that he was a Christian and a Portuguese citizen who had fully adapted to Brazil&rsquo;s culture. The provincial authorities counter-claimed that de Jesus had allowed Mal&ecirc; conspirators to meet in his house and been involved in other revolts before 1835.

The archival records are sparse, but an inventory lists Felisberta as a Cabinda slave from Africa (modern Angola or Congo), which was not very common among contemporary household slaves.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFelisberta was enslaved on a large coffee plantation known as fazenda Pau Grande in Rio de Janeiro Province. She served Joaquim Ribeiro de Avellar Junior, the future viscount of Ub&aacute;, and his new wife Mariana Velho de Avellar. In January 1857, the couple chose Felisberta to be the wet nurse (\\u003Cem\\u003Eama-de-leite\\u003C\\/em\\u003E) to their daughter Luiza. In March 1858 she also breastfed their next daughter, Julia. In May 1862, the family sent Felisberta to Rio de Janeiro to breastfeed and care for Maria Izabel, her mistress Mariana&rsquo;s niece.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDomestic slavery was a widespread practice in nineteenth-century Rio, with slaves performing many functions for wealthy families. Working with the Ribeiro de Avellar family probably as a \\u003Cem\\u003Emucama \\u003C\\/em\\u003E(private maid), Felisberta had to learn new habits to be able to accompany Mariana and her daughters on social occasions. The majority of materials on child care during the Brazilian Empire recommended the exclusive care of one wet nurse to protect the health of the baby. The child&rsquo;s parents were to guarantee that the wet nurse maintain proper eating and sleeping habits to safeguard the future health and character of their children. Based on her experience as a wet nurse, it appears that Felisberta experienced three or more pregnancies between November&ndash;December of 1856 and May&ndash;June of 1862. She was probably among the many enslaved wet nurses who were not allowed to breastfeed their own children, instead handing them over to other slave women of the same household.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFelisberta remained in Rio to serve as a wet nurse until the end of 1862 when she returned to fazenda Pau Grande for health treatment. Upon her return, she was described by her mistress as &ldquo;already too old to serve as wet nurse, but still a caring and clean person.&rdquo; She served her masters by ironing clothes, cooking, and housekeeping.

He was already freed by 1830, when one document refers to him as a \\u003Cem\\u003Ecapit&atilde;o de campo\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (militia officer, a post no slave could hold) in Maranh&atilde;o province.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ECosme was arrested and imprisoned for homicide in 1830. He escaped twice. By his second escape in 1839, a major civil war known as the Balaiada was already ravaging Maranh&atilde;o province. The Balaiada grew out of violent conflicts between liberals and conservatives in the early Brazilian Empire, in particular resistance by the poor free population to compulsory military service. This population consisted mainly of \\u003Cem\\u003Evaqueiros\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (cowboys) and\\u003Cem\\u003E caboclos\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, (peasants), many of whom were nonwhite. They greatly resented the massive draft of their most productive labor force into the army and feared re-enslavement, prompting them to rebel along with Maroon groups in 1838.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn November 1839, Cosme emerged as the main leader of the three-thousand Maroons of the Itapecuru Valley. He forced local slaveholders to sign letters granting freedom to their slaves and sent letters to authorities, proclaiming that the \\u003Cem\\u003ELei da Rep&uacute;blica\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (Law of the Republic) had replaced the \\u003Cem\\u003ELei da Escravid&atilde;o\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (Law of Slavery), and that planters would have to manumit and pay their slaves.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ECosme made repeated offers of cooperation to rebels in his area, who called themselves \\u003Cem\\u003EBem-te-vis\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, the nickname for liberals in Maranh&atilde;o. He signed his letters &ldquo;Tutor Emperor of Freedom, Defender of the Bem-te-vis,&rdquo; which reveals an interesting attempt to combine imperial traditions with the revolutionary discourse of freedom and liberalism.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the last phase of the Balaiada (February 1840&ndash;February 1841), the governor forced rebels wanting to surrender to hunt down Maroons in order to receive an imperial offer of amnesty. Some Bem-te-vi officers complied with this requirement, which helped to sow confusion in the rebel ranks. Cosme&rsquo;s Maroons were finally taken prisoner on February 7, 1841 signaling the end of the rebellion. Cosme was condemned to death by a jury in Itapecuru-Mirim and executed by hanging in September 1842.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ECosme&rsquo;s legacy is a reminder of the fragile nature of freedom under slave societies and the fragmentation caused by divisions of race and slave status.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.73613\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Matthias R\\u00f6hrig Assun\\u00e7\\u00e3o in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EEvaristo, Romeu. &ldquo;Her&oacute;is de Todo Mundo - NEGRO COSME&rdquo; \\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=RQDNy7124kU\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=RQDNy7124kU\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EAra&uacute;jo, Mundinha. \\u003Cem\\u003EEm busca de Dom Cosme Bento das Chagas, Negro Cosme: Tutor e imperador da liberdade\\u003C\\/em\\u003E.

He was probably captured and enslaved by the Fon at a young age. Azata was sent to Brazil where he was purchased and later freed by slave trader Captain Manuel Joaquim d&rsquo;Almeida. Azata took his master&rsquo;s name after he was emancipated and baptized.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAfter manumission, d&rsquo;Almeida continued to work with his former master in the slave trade.

According to his last will and testament, written in Salvador in 1844, d&rsquo;Almeida already possessed a significant fortune.

Joaquim d&rsquo;Almeida is credited as the first slave trader outside of the de Souza family to gain the king&rsquo;s approval, thus opening trade up to other merchants and helping him to establish his own monopoly in Agou&eacute;. Later, he was named a customs officer in charge of tax collection for trade between Agou&eacute; and nearby Little Popo, which increased both his political and economic power.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn 1848 d&rsquo;Almeida established himself in Ouidah and quickly became the richest and most influential resident of that city. When the British took control of nearby Danish slave posts in 1850, he was forced back to Agou&eacute; where he spent the remainder of his life. According to legend, a fellow Afro-Brazilian poisoned d&rsquo;Almeida after a dispute over money in 1857.

All known information about her derives from a Federal Writers&rsquo; Project interview that she gave in Durham, North Carolina in 1937. She claimed to be 103 years old at the time of the interview.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAlthough she shared little about her childhood and did not name her own parents, she went into great detail about her owners, George and Betsy Herndon, who owned a plantation in Chatham County. The Herndon plantation grew corn, cotton, and tobacco, as well as raised cattle, sheep, and hogs. A large slave population was employed to run the Herndon plantation. Durham worked in a large weaving room on the plantation, helping other female slaves weave blankets and winter clothing. In her interview, Durham recalled the singing of the slaves as they worked spinning.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhile much of Durham&rsquo;s memories shed a positive light on her experience as a slave on the Herndon plantation, moments in her interview reveal the powerlessness she and other slaves felt on these plantations. In particular, in discussing her wedding to Exter Durham, a slave on the nearby Snipes Durham plantation in Orange County, although the wedding was held on the front porch of the house and she wore a wedding gown made by her mistress from curtains in the big house, Herndon only allowed the couple to stay together on their wedding night and then forced Exter to return to the Snipes Durham plantation the next day. From that point on, Durham&rsquo;s husband was only allowed to return to the Herndon plantation on Saturday nights.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn her interview, Durham hypothesized that these weekly visits were allowed by the Herndons to help expand their slave workforce. As she gave birth to nine children before the Civil War, Durham felt that her childbearing abilities made her more valuable in the eyes of her masters. During the war, she remembered that the workers on the plantation had plenty to eat compared with others and she credited that to Herndon remaining at home during the fighting to continue to tend the crops and care for the livestock.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAfter emancipation, Durham remembered being thrilled that she could finally stay with her husband. They had two more children post-emancipation, totaling eleven children during their marriage. Exter Durham moved onto the Herndon plantation where they remained for several years, entering into a sharecropper agreement, renting the land for a quarter of their profits and over time saving three-hundred dollars to purchase a farm of their own. Although Durham&rsquo;s recollections seem excessively positive compared to those of other WPA interviewees, she did not deny that her experience may have been exceptional since the Herndons were relatively kind owners. Recollections of Durham and others interviewed by the Federal Writers&rsquo; Project provide key testimonies to the era of slavery and the transition to freedom.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.36748\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Steven J.

Pritchard was captured, taken to Zanzibar, and sold to Zephaniah Kingsley in 1805. Although little is known about his early life, at the time of his enslavement he was already an established conjurer. Jack was taken to Kingsley&rsquo;s plantation in East Florida but shortly after was purchased by Paul Pritchard, a Charleston shipbuilder, to work on the docks as a joiner and caulker in April 1806.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs an urban slave with considerable skill as both a laborer and conjurer, Jack was able to live off Pritchard&rsquo;s property and hired out his time around the city. Jack was well-respected as an African priest and an important member of the African church in the Hampstead neighborhood of Charleston. Jack held a great degree of influence over the African American community due to his connections within the church, his perceived spiritual authority as a healer, and his memorable physical appearance (he was remembered as having large whiskers).\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EJack befriended Denmark Vesey around 1817. Vesey was a wealthy free slave whose influence in the community rivaled Jack&rsquo;s. Together, these two men held considerable sway over the African American community in Charleston and in 1821 Vesey approached Jack about organizing a slave revolt in Charleston. Jack aided Vesey in the plans for the rebellion by acting as a recruiter at community meetings and utilizing his spiritual powers to perform elaborate initiation rituals to ensure loyalty to the cause. Later, a number of those involved in the revolt would claim that Jack controlled them by magic and that he was to blame for their wrongdoings during what was to become known as the Denmark Vesey Rebellion, the largest slave conspiracy in North American history.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn addition to recruiting participants, Jack also aided Vesey in planning to poison the Charleston water supply and they also planned to lead a contingent of Vesey&rsquo;s followers to seize and distribute weapons throughout Charleston on the day of the rebellion. Things did not go as planned, however, when informers betrayed Vesey&rsquo;s plans. On June 17, 1822, authorities began to gather conspirators in the plan for trial; Vesey and Pritchard evaded arrest even though their trial began on June 19. Vesey was captured on June 22 and although Pritchard and others schemed to free him, they were unsuccessful. Pritchard was captured on July 5, the day before another conspiracy was set to begin. On July 9, white authorities sentenced him to death for his role in the conspiracy.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.38513\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Nathaniel Millett in the \\u003Cem\\u003EAfrican American National Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003E&quot;Denmark Vesey,&quot;\\u003Cem\\u003E This Far by Faith\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, \\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.pbs.org\\/thisfarbyfaith\\/people\\/denmark_vesey.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.pbs.org\\/thisfarbyfaith\\/people\\/denmark_vesey.html\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&ldquo;Sentence of Gullah Jack,&rdquo; \\u003Cem\\u003EAfricans in America\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, \\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.pbs.org\\/wgbh\\/aia\\/part3\\/3h497t.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.pbs.org\\/wgbh\\/aia\\/part3\\/3h497t.html\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EEgerton, Douglas.&nbsp;\\u003Cem\\u003EHe Shall Go Free: The Lives of Denmark Vesey\\u003C\\/em\\u003E.

In 1836, Portugal passed laws to abolish the slave trade, but this law did not immediately go into effect in Angola. Traders resisted the law and widespread corruption in the colonial government slowed the implementation of this legislation. In 1850, Portugal abolished the slave trade in Brazil, eliminating the main market for Angolan slaves.

She lent money to other Angolan merchants and traders, but also to the Portuguese colonial government. Her investments expanded inland, investing in long-distance trade between the coast of Angola and states of the interior. She lent money to interior Portuguese traders (sertanejos) and African and mestizo traders (pombeiros). One of her most famous trade partners was Portuguese trader Joaquim Rodrigues Graca. Graca had been commissioned by Portugal in 1843 to establish trade links with the kingdom of Luanda (portions of present-day Angola and Democratic Republic of Congo). Although Portugal was unable to entice the Luandan king into a dependent political relationship, trade relationships between Luanda and Angola were formed. Due to her involvement in all of these businesses, Ana Joaquina dos Santos e Silva, popularly known as Dona Ana Mulata, died a wealthy woman in Lisbon, Portugal in 1859.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.49890\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Douglas Wheeler in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of African Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\",\"Online Resources\":null,\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EClarence&shy;-Smith, G. \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Third Portuguese Empire, 1825&ndash;1975: A Study in Economic Imperialism\\u003C\\/em\\u003E.

Born in Inverness, Scotland, John Frazer worked as a merchant for Glasgow- and Liverpool-based trading firms, and eventually ended up in the Pongo River region sometime in the 1790s. Frazer maintained a slave-trading establishment at Bangalan on the upper Pongo River, meeting and marrying Phenda, the widow of Thomas Hughes Jackson (another European trader) in 1799 at Isle de Los. John and Phenda had five children together including Elizabeth. Elizabeth, along with her sisters Eleanor and Mary Ann, were baptized and attended a school established by the Church Missionary Society at Bashia on the Pongo River.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nWhile leaving Phenda in charge of the trading hub at Bangalan, Frazer also maintained residences in Liverpool and Charleston, South Carolina. Frazer moved to Charleston to expand his trading business in 1807, eventually settling in Spanish Florida following the United States&rsquo; ban on the importation of African slaves in 1808. In December 1813, he drowned in Florida, regarded at the time of his death at one of the wealthiest men in Florida due to his ownership of two plantations and nearly four-hundred slaves, in addition to his properties in South Carolina, Britain, and West Africa. Frazer left his fortune to his children, leaving Andrew Charles and Thomas Napier as executors of his estate and guardians of his children. Although their inheritance made each of the Frazer children very wealthy in their own rights, problems with delivering the inheritance meant that it would be decades before Elizabeth, the only surviving child, received her inheritance.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nAs the struggle to secure the family inheritance continued, Elizabeth set out to travel, following her siblings James and Margaret to England, living in Liverpool for four years with Thomas Powell, her father&rsquo;s former agent. She also traveled to France where she studied French, resulting in a fluency in that language, along with English and several African languages. Following her return to Guinea\\/Conakry, Elizabeth met and married William Skelton, Jr., a trader, on July 24, 1826 at Kissing on the Pongo River. William came from a similar background as Elizabeth. He was the son of an English trader who operated a slave factory at Kissing and an African mother. Before marrying Elizabeth, William had participated in the Trans-Atlantic slave trade before returning to the Pongo River region to apprentice under a local Dutch businessman. Records show that Elizabeth and William had at least two children, Mary Anne and Emma.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nTogether with her husband, Elizabeth established a successful trading company at Victoria, near the mouth of the Nunez River, which operated from 1826 to 1846. Victoria represented the port of entry from oceangoing vessels traveling inward via the river. And Elizabeth, with her mastery of multiple languages and experience in European customs, used her skills to facilitate trade and diplomacy with incoming ships. She forged partnerships with powerful Euro-African families through her dealings in business and facilitated the marriage of her children to several of these families. Following the death of her husband in 1843, Elizabeth also entered into a strategic marriage with John Bicaise, a Trinidadian migrant and leading trader in the region who represented French trading interests on Goree Island. While Elizabeth and her husband(s) certainly engaged in legitimate business pursuits, it is widely understood and accepted that they also traded in slaves, following the example led by her father John.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EElizabeth&rsquo;s sister Mary Ann also proved an astute businesswoman in partnership with her husband Thomas Gaffery Curtis, another merchant of mixed race. From the time of their father&rsquo;s death in 1813 to the time of Mary Ann&rsquo;s death in 1846 (Eleanor had passed much earlier in the 1820s), Elizabeth continued to fight to gain her father&rsquo;s full inheritance. By the time the fortune was disentangled from the British, Spanish, American, and African bureaucracies at play, Elizabeth inherited a significant fortune in land and monies, allowing her to further grow her business interests. Although it is unclear when Elizabeth passed, but records show that her husband, John Bicaise, remained active in the region as late as 1880.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.49988\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Bruce L.

Governor John Hunter offered a reward of five gallons of rum for his capture, resulting in John Winbow shooting and killing him on February 15, 1796.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.73395\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Kimberly Cheek in the \\u003Cem\\u003EAfrican American National Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003E&ldquo;John Caesar&rdquo; in \\u003Cem\\u003EAustralian Dictionary of Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E: \\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/adb.anu.edu.au\\/biography\\/caesar-john-black-12829\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttp:\\/\\/adb.anu.edu.au\\/biography\\/caesar-john-black-12829\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EGillen, Mollie. \\u003Cem\\u003EFounders of Australia: A Biographical Dictionary of the First Fleet. \\u003C\\/em\\u003ESydney: Library of Australian History, 1989.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp xmlns=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.w3.org\\/1999\\/html\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nKimberly, M.

When he was two-and-a-half years old, he was captured and enslaved along with his father, mother, brothers, and sisters. Upon arriving in North America, they were sold to Oliver and Angelika Triebuen near New York City, for whom they worked long hours and were given meager amounts of food.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nAs an adolescent, Jea searched for religious meaning in his life, finally finding it in Christianity. In his autobiography, he reported of his baptism around the age of fifteen, which he claimed he leveraged against his master for his freedom. Historians claim that this seems unlikely, since American laws at this time did not require masters to free baptized slaves. They thus argue that Jea&rsquo;s autobiography should not be understood as literal history, but as a text of religious importance used in favor of the cause of the abolition of slavery. Historians also believe that his autobiography was not written by Jea himself, but dictated.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nIn Jea&rsquo;s \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Life, History, and Unparalleled Sufferings of John Jea, the African Preacher\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, he recounted preaching in North America, Europe, and the East Indies. He also discussed three different marriages, one to a Native American, one to a native of Malta, and his last wife an Irishwoman. He reported that his first wife, Elizabeth, was pressured by her employer to renounce Jea because they believed his religiosity offensive. Jea wrote that his wife became emotionally unstable and killed their daughter and her own mother. He claimed Elizabeth was an unrepentant sinner, but historians dispute this, claiming that she became mentally deranged due to stresses from her husband and employer as well as her disadvantageous position as a Native American woman reliant on others for economic support. Records from Portsmouth, England, list Jea&rsquo;s marriage to Jemima Davis, who would thus be his fourth wife. In 1817, following the publication of his autobiography, Jemima gave birth to their daughter, Hephzabah.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nJea&rsquo;s \\u003Cem\\u003ELife\\u003C\\/em\\u003E presents many fantastical claims. He stated that he prayed to become literate, and an angel granted him the ability to read the Bible, but left him unable to read anything else. In this way, Jea&rsquo;s writings reflect the wider spread of evangelical Protestantism and a rejection of more hierarchical forms of Christianity. Evangelical Christianity usually resonated much more with West African slaves than other popular branches of Christianity, reinforcing West African beliefs in deities that actively intervened in the world.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nJohn Jea&rsquo;s autobiography is most notable for its religious and abolitionist dimensions. He viewed slavery and freedom as religious questions, where slavery was anathema to Christian belief. By keeping Christianity away from slaves, and putting forth masters as the guides of slaves rather than God, slavery corrupted the moral fabric of society. Jea&rsquo;s own resistance to slavery involved his conversion to Christianity and his subsequent liberation from slavery. He gained his freedom and found his paid work, although he struggled with the racism of early America.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nLittle is known about Jea&rsquo;s death, but historians believe he died around 1817.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.35768\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Richard J.

He was a mason, militia captain, and property owner. According to his burial record, Mongoula was born in 1720. There are records of two children named Nicolas born to enslaved black mothers in Mobile that year, but it is impossible to know whether Mongoula was one of these two. At the time of his birth, Mobile was a part of the French colony of Louisiana. Mongoula&rsquo;s last name meant &ldquo;my friend&rdquo; in Mobilian Jargon, a pidgin language used throughout the region that combined aspects of several different Native American languages.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMany different Native American groups used Mobilian Jargon to communicate and trade with each other, and there were some Africans and Europeans who learned the language in order to communicate with Native Americans in the area. During Mobile&rsquo;s French period, Native American and African slavery both existed, especially during the 1720s, the decade of Mongoula&rsquo;s birth. About half of Mobile&rsquo;s households owned slaves, and usually had both African and Native American slaves. Because they often lived and worked together, African and Native American slaves developed sexual relationships, married, and served as godparents to each other&rsquo;s children. These relationships continued after the acquisition of Mobile by the British following the close of the French and Indian War in 1763.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDuring the American Revolution, Mobile became a part of Spanish West Florida, where it would remain until after Mongoula&rsquo;s death. The Spanish abolished Native American slavery in Florida in 1780, but the close relationship between African-born or descended people and Native Americans continued. Mongoula may have been familiar with Mobilian Jargon through these relationships, but it is impossible to know.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMongoula became a prominent free person of color in Spanish Mobile. Three different Catholic baptisms in Mobile between 1764 and 1781 record Mongoula as the godfather to enslaved Africans. Because he was free and owned property, Mongoula was a popular godfather. Spanish records describe him as a &ldquo;master mason,&rdquo; and historians speculate he may have built the house that he sold to a man named Hugh Krebs in 1792. He was also commissioned by the Spanish government as the captain of a local militia composed of free people of color in case of an attack on Mobile.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHistorical records shed little light on Mongoula&rsquo;s life. He married a free black woman named Francisco Mimi, a marriage recorded in the records of Mobile&rsquo;s Catholic Church. They had at least two children, Santiago and Luisa. Records show Santiago was employed as a carpenter in New Orleans in the 1790s, and as a non-commissioned officer in New Orleans&rsquo; free black militia. Luisa&rsquo;s life is also mostly unknown, though she was unmarried and living in Mobile at the time of her father&rsquo;s death in 1798.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOn April 1, 1798, Nicolas Mongoula dictated his last will and testament. His wife was to gain their possessions: their land and a cabin in Mobile, ten or twelve&nbsp;heads of cattle, and land by St. Stephens Creek, where they had grown rice, corn, and beans. Mongoula died a month later, on May 2, 1798. He received a Catholic burial with full rites in Mobile&rsquo;s parish church. During Mongoula&rsquo;s life, Mobile was a part of French Louisiana, British West Florida, and then finally Spanish West Florida. Fifteen years after his death, in 1813, the United States captured Mobile during the War of 1812.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.37526\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by David Wheat in the \\u003Cem\\u003EAfrican American National Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Online Resources\":null,\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EDrechsel, Emanuel J.&nbsp;\\u003Cem\\u003EMobilian Jargon: Linguistic and Sociohistorical Aspects of a Native American Pidgin.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/em\\u003EOxford: Clarendon Press, 1997.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nHanger, Kimberly S.&nbsp;\\u003Cem\\u003EBounded Lives, Bounded Places: Free Black Society in Colonial New Orleans, 1769-1803.\\u003C\\/em\\u003E Durham: Duke University Press, 1997.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nLanders, Jane.&nbsp;\\u003Cem\\u003EBlack Society in Spanish Florida.\\u003C\\/em\\u003E Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1999.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nUsner, Daniel H., Jr.&nbsp;\\u003Cem\\u003EIndians, Settlers &amp; Slaves in a Frontier Exchange Economy: The Lower Mississippi Valley before 1783.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/em\\u003EChapel Hill: Published for the Institute of Early American History and Culture by the University of North Carolina Press,1992.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nWheat, David. &quot;Mongoula, Nicolas.&quot;&nbsp;\\u003Cem\\u003EAfrican American National Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, edited by Ed.

Amador&rsquo;s date of birth is unknown, but he was born on S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nS&atilde;o Tom&eacute; was uninhabited when the Portuguese arrived on the island around 1471. Beginning in 1493, Portuguese colonists established sugarcane plantations on the island. To work on these plantations, the Portuguese brought slaves from nearby parts of Africa. Over the course of the sixteenth century, sugar became dominant throughout S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;. However, slaves on the island did not passively accept their fate. They frequently ran away, establishing maroon communities in nearby mountainous forests. From these communities, they attacked plantations and the town of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;. In response, Portuguese authorities created a militia to fight these runaway slave communities and protect the European settlers. During the late sixteenth century, the sugar industry in S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; became less important with the rise of sugar production in Brazil. Divisions between the governor, the bishop, and the town council created political instability.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nAmador took advantage of political tension to lead his revolt. On July 9, 1595, Amador and two other slaves, Lazaro and Domingo, led a group of slaves into the parish church in the town of Trindade and killed Portuguese men attending Catholic Mass. In the following days, an increasing number of slaves attacked plantations and burned sugar mills and plantation houses. On July 11, the militia and rebels fought again, resulting in the death of three Portuguese. Another battle followed on July 14, and the slaves fled. Amador proclaimed himself the king of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;, and organized his runaway slave army into four units. Each unit attacked a key area of the town of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;r, but the Portuguese militia pushed the slaves back.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nAmador&rsquo;s army continued to attack the town for the next two weeks. With an army reportedly containing five thousand slaves, Amador waged one last assault on the town on July 28. Over two hundred soldiers died during this assault, including Lazaro, one of Amador&rsquo;s commanders. The Portuguese governor offered clemency to any slave who surrendered, and more than four thousand accepted his offer on July 29.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nEventually, one of Amador&rsquo;s confidantes betrayed him and Amador was arrested. On August 14, 1595, the Portuguese hung and quartered Amador and placed his heart on a pillow. Amador&rsquo;s slave revolt was one of the greatest slave uprisings in Atlantic history. His army had destroyed most of the island&rsquo;s sugar mills, and accelerated the movement of plantations away from S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; to Brazil before its eventual overthrow.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nAfter S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and the neighboring island of Pr&iacute;ncipe gained independence in 1975, the government proclaimed Amador a national hero of the anti-colonial struggle. In 1976, the S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe government replaced the Portuguese escudo with a new currency, the dobra, and incorporated Amador&rsquo;s portrait in the country&rsquo;s currency. No images of Amador exist so a local artist created a portrait of him. In 2004, the National Assembly of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; declared January 4 a national holiday in honor of Amador, and United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan inaugurated a statue of Amador in S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.48231\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Gerhard Seibert in the \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of African Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EGerhard Seibert, &ldquo;Rei Amador, hist&oacute;ria e mito do l&iacute;der da revolta de escravos em S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; (1595),&rdquo;\\u003Cem\\u003E Buala \\u003C\\/em\\u003E(2011).&nbsp;\\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.buala.org\\/pt\\/a-ler\\/rei-amador-historia-e-mito-do-lider-da-revolta-de-escravos-em-sao-tome-1595\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttp:\\/\\/www.buala.org\\/pt\\/a-ler\\/rei-amador-historia-e-mito-do-lider-da-revolta-de-escravos-em-sao-tome-1595\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EGarfield, Robert. \\u003Cem\\u003EA History of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; Island, 1470-1655: The Key to Guinea\\u003C\\/em\\u003E.

He experienced and even led some of Brazil&rsquo;s greatest historical transformations: from a slave society to industrial capitalism, and from the imperial era to the Vargas nation-state.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nSampaio was born on January 7, 1855 in Santo Amaro da Purifica&ccedil;&atilde;o, Bahia, Brazil. His mother, Domingas da Paixao do Carmo, was enslaved and his father was most likely her master. His father apparently granted him freedom at birth or shortly thereafter as Sampaio lived his entire life a free man.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nAt age 9 Sampaio moved from Bahia to S&atilde;o Paulo, and then to Rio de Janeiro where he studied engineering at the elite Escola Polit&eacute;cnica do Rio de Janeiro. During his studies he also lectured on engineering and worked as an architectural draftsman for the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nSampaio was a pioneer in the fields of engineering and national infrastructure development in Brazil. In 1879 he was named as a member of the prestigious Comiss&atilde;o Hidr&aacute;ulica do Imp&eacute;rio, tasked with supporting industry in the interior by connecting it via railway to the ports of Rio, Bahia, and Pernambuco. Sampaio specifically oversaw the construction of the railway between Salvador da Bahia and S&atilde;o Francisco.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nToward the end of the S&atilde;o Francisco expedition, Sampaio trekked through the Chapada Diamantina region and the \\u003Cem\\u003Esert&otilde;es\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (hinterlands) of Bahia.

There are two towns named after him in Brazil, one in the state of Bahia and another in the state of S&atilde;o Paulo. A major road in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo is also named for him. Sampaio&rsquo;s experiences and achievements would be remarkable for any person from any walk of life, but they are particularly impressive considering his birth to an enslaved mother in a society deeply structured by racism and oligarchic power.

Castro&rsquo;s thesis, &ldquo;Of Hallucinations and Illusions,&rdquo; reflected his extensive interest in psychiatry. He taught psychiatry at the medical school for two months until his death in 1890.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nCastro was a disciple of the Brazilian intellectual Silvio Romero and a keen reader of social theory and craniology, including works by Darwinist Ernst Haekel, sociologist Auguste Comte, and Brazilian intellectuals. He was a key member of the \\u003Cem\\u003EEscola do Recife\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (Recife School) of social thought that gained influence in the 1870s. Castro&rsquo;s writings became noteworthy for their emphasis on positivist approaches to modern Brazilian problems. His most well-known work was \\u003Cem\\u003EWomen and Sociogenesis\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, a study addressing the importance of education for the betterment of all women. Castro emphatically believed that women were inferior to men, but that they could be uplifted by education and societal emphasis on overcoming the differences between males and females. Castro&rsquo;s ideas about race and society predated some of the formulations about Brazil as a racial democracy developed by sociologist Gilberto Freyre that would reach a far wider audience several decades later. In an 1889 essay titled &ldquo;Hatred among Races,&rdquo; Castro emphasized the democratic character of Brazil&rsquo;s race relations, even during slavery, and was a keen supporter of the transition to the Brazilian Republic. Romero helped to disseminate that essay and other writings Castro left behind, especially through the posthumous publication \\u003Cem\\u003EQuestions and Problems\\u003C\\/em\\u003E in 1913.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.73589\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Daniel Richter in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Online Resources\":null,\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EAndrews, George Reid. &ldquo;Brazilian Racial Democracy, 1900&ndash;90: An American Counterpoint.&rdquo; \\u003Cem\\u003EJournal of Contemporary History\\u003C\\/em\\u003E 31 (1996): 483&ndash;507.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nAraujo de Almeida, Ana Maria. &ldquo;Um &lsquo;mesti&ccedil;o irrecus&aacute;vel&rsquo;: Tito L&iacute;vio de Castro e o pensamento cientificista no Brasil do s&eacute;culo XIX.&rdquo; M.A. thesis, Federal University of Minas Gerais, 2008.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nCastro, Tito Livio de. \\u003Cem\\u003EA mulher e a sociogenia: Obra posthuma, publicada sob a direc&ccedil;\\u0101o de Manoel da Costa Paes\\u003C\\/em\\u003E.

Unlike most of his contemporaries, Ricardo managed to establish himself as a merchant and even acquire slaves of his own while still enslaved in Salvador de Bahia. Like his former master, Ricardo would eventually invest in slave trading and other merchant activities on the African continent.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nThe prosperity Ricardo enjoyed is attested by the large house he occupied until his death, which included slave quarters. Many of Ricardo&rsquo;s slaves were listed as wage-earners (\\u003Cem\\u003Eescravos de ganho\\u003C\\/em\\u003E), urban slaves who generated good incomes for their masters by selling diverse goods on the streets of Salvador. In turn, wage-earning slaves shared a small part of the master&rsquo;s profits, enabling many to save enough money to purchase their own freedom.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nRicardo&rsquo;s life was disrupted by the 1835 slave and Muslim-led uprising known as the Mal&ecirc; Revolt. The provincial government promptly issued a law targeting African residents, leading to mass imprisonment, confiscation of property, and deportation to Africa. Not directly charged, Ricardo nevertheless had to employ ingenious maneuvers to avoid penalties. These included purchasing property in the name of his Brazilian-born children and redirecting investments to the purchase of slaves, one of the few remaining legal economic activities for freed Africans.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nLikely a Muslim by origin, Ricard was a self-declared Catholic but also maintained close connections to Candombl&eacute;, an Afro-Brazilian syncretic religion centered on the cult of the Yorub&aacute; Orishas (deities). He was friends with the freed African and Candombl&eacute; priest Domingos Sodr&eacute;, and oral tradition suggests that he was the founding priest of the highly regarded Oxumar&eacute; temple in Salvador. It is plausible that Ricardo tried to keep his Afro-Brazilian religiosity out of the spotlight to avoid police repression.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nUpon his death in 1865, Ricardo was given a full Catholic burial. The fortune he left behind included land, three houses, and twenty-seven slaves. As such, he occupied a rare position among the narrow economic elite of Bahia, consisting mostly of free born Euro-descendants.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.74913\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Genaro Vilanova Miranda de Oliveira in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003ECasa de &Ograve;s&ugrave;m&agrave;r&egrave; (website). \\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.casadeoxumare.com.br\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ewww.casadeoxumare.com.br\\u003C\\/a\\u003E.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;&ldquo;Voyage 51434, Ceres (1806)&rdquo; \\u003Cem\\u003EVoyages: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.slavevoyages.org\\/voyage\\/51434\\/variables\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E http:\\/\\/www.slavevoyages.org\\/voyage\\/51434\\/variables\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&ldquo;Voyage 51476, Ceres (1807)&rdquo; \\u003Cem\\u003EVoyages: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.slavevoyages.org\\/voyage\\/51476\\/variables\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E http:\\/\\/www.slavevoyages.org\\/voyage\\/51476\\/variables\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003ECastillo, Lisa Earl. &ldquo;O terreiro do Alaketu e seus fundadores: Hist&oacute;ria e genealogia familiar, 1807&ndash;1867.&rdquo; \\u003Cem\\u003EAfro-&Aacute;sia\\u003C\\/em\\u003E 43 (2011): 213&ndash;59.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp xmlns=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.w3.org\\/1999\\/html\\\"\\u003Ede Oliveira, Genaro Vilanova Miranda. &quot;Ricardo, Manoel Joaquim.&quot;&nbsp;\\u003Cem\\u003EDictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography&nbsp;\\u003C\\/em\\u003E, edited by Ed.

Little is known about his early life, but his father became his master and also a general on the rebel side fighting for independence for the state of Rio Grande do Sul in the Farroupilha civil war (1835&ndash;45).\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nBeing the son of a general did not grant Netto special treatment and he was never acknowledged as a legitimate heir, but participation in the war effort offered a potential path for slaves to earn freedom.

His military service also translated into social advancement as he eventually became a foreman who led troops and oversaw a pasture or a meat-salting area (\\u003Cem\\u003Echarqueada\\u003C\\/em\\u003E), an unobtainable position for most former slaves.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nOn December 13, 1856 Netto gathered four of his subordinates in order to punish Agostinho, a man of mixed Afro-Brazilian descent. Although both men enjoyed important positions on the plantation, Netto was Agostinho&rsquo;s superior. Netto acted as the oppressor of his underlings, distancing himself from the world in which he had been a part and irritating Agosthinho through his actions. Agostinho also accused Netto of making advances on his fianc&eacute;, a slave named Juliana. Agostinho tried to negotiate his punishment, saying that what Netto had decided was unfair. This enraged Netto, who drew a knife and advanced upon Agostinho. Agostinho responded by disarming Netto and wounding him fatally in the chest.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nAgostinho confessed to murder before a Rio Pardo jury and was sentenced to death on September 19, 1857. The law on which his sentence was based, passed in the aftermath of a series of 1830s insurrections, imposed greater penalties for crimes committed against slave owners, their families, taskmasters, and foremen.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nWhile military service was sometimes a path to manumission, Netto&rsquo;s is the only known situation in which a slave was granted manumission due to direct participation in the Farroupilha civil war.

Soubise was an eighteenth-century &ldquo;dandy&rdquo; and one of Britain&rsquo;s first black sex symbols. Attempts to trace Soubise&rsquo;s life of servitude in the Caribbean have&nbsp; yielded few concrete results, but the historian Vincent Caretta has suggested that his father was probably free and white and his mother an enslaved person of African descent.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EIn 1764 when Soubise was&nbsp; aged 10, Captain Stair Douglas of the British Royal Navy took possession of him and brought him&nbsp; to England. Almost immediately upon his arrival, Douglas handed over the enslaved to Catherine Hyde Douglas, the 64-year-old duchess of Queensberry, who apparently was instantaneously charmed by the youth&rsquo;s good looks and pleasing manners. She christened the boy Julius Soubise, perhaps after Charles de Rohan, prince de Soubise, then a fashionable French courtier of King Louis XV.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EFrom the time he was adopted into the Queensberry&rsquo;s household, all trappings of his servile status disappeared and he was groomed to become a member of the aristocracy. In his new home of privilege and luxurious comfort, he was esteemed as the &ldquo;young Othello&rdquo; and was enrolled in the Domenico Angelo Academy, the leading institution of the day in fencing and equestrianism. Soubise proved to be&nbsp; a quick and talented student. From the visitor&rsquo;s gallery of the Angelo Academy, he was soon&nbsp; entertaining his lady and her friends in both disciplines. The duke eventually made him an assistant in training students to ride and fence. This appointment caused his popularity to soar all the higher.&nbsp; Soubise also accompanied the duke&rsquo;s son to the prestigious colleges of Eton and Windsor.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EIn the 1760s and early 1770s, Soubise emerged as one of the most well-known black men in England.&nbsp; Duke Angelo embraced his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; and not only engaged him in sports but also widened his&nbsp; social experiences by selecting him as a companion to exclusive all-male dinner parties. The gifted and&nbsp; gracious Soubise was active in endearing his patrons for he had cultivated other socially useful skills&nbsp; such as playing the violin, singing, oratory, and poetry. He was frequently called upon to entertain his white hosts and eagerly obliged. His patron ensured that at these and other gatherings Soubise was&nbsp; always impeccably dressed. In fact, as was customary among the rich and well-born in mid-eighteenth century England, Catherine Hyde displayed her wealth by subjecting Soubise to exaggerated fashion&nbsp; and he apparently acquiesced. The scholar Monica Miller wrote in her 2009 study of black dandyism that Soubise wore &ldquo;diamond buckled, red heeled shoes as he circulated through the social scenes of&nbsp; eighteenth century London&rdquo; (p. 77). Soubise would also befriend other celebrities of the day including&nbsp; the actor Richard Garrick and the black writer and abolitionist Ignatius Sancho. Sancho cautioned&nbsp; Soubise against philandering and wild behavior, but the younger man paid little heed to his elder&rsquo;s&nbsp; advice.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EHis charm and good luck still sufficiently intact in India, Soubise made the most of his new situation&nbsp; over the next two decades.

On August 25, 1798 he died from injuries sustained after falling from a&nbsp; horse he was attempting to tame. He was survived by his wife (her name and the date of their&nbsp; marriage are unknown) and two children, a son, Frederick William, and a daughter, Mary.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.75153\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Gelien Matthews&nbsp;in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp\\u003EThe British Museum: \\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.britishmuseum.org\\/collection\\/term\\/BIOG182000\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.britishmuseum.org\\/collection\\/term\\/BIOG182000\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EEdwards, Paul Geoffrey, and James Walvin.

Her poetry and prose indicate familiarity with animistic ancestor worship, solar worship, Islam, and an African consciousness she brought to North America after she was captured aged 7 or 8, enslaved, and forced aboard the Phillis, a brigantine owned by Timothy Fitch of Medford, Massachusetts and captained by Peter Gwinn of Boston. According to the Slave Voyages Database, she embarked from the Windward Coast of Africa with 95 fellow Africans and was one of 76 who survived the deprivations of the ship&rsquo;s cramped and squalid conditions and arrived in Boston 245 days later, wearing only a scrap of carpet. On 11 July&nbsp;1761, she was sold on the block &ldquo;for a trifle&rdquo; to John and Susanna Wheatley, prominent Bostonians who named her after the slave ship that brought her to America. Her name was thus a constant reminder of her enslavement and suffering during the Middle Passage.\\u003Cb\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\/b\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ESeeing Phillis attempt to write, the Wheatleys encouraged her to read and write, first in English, then Latin. At age 12 she published her first poem in a local newspaper, but many Bostonians doubted that a young African woman could craft such reasoned and elegant poetry. She successfully defended her intelligence and literary skills before an inquisition by New England&rsquo;s finest minds, but still failed to find a local publisher for a collection of her poetry. Wheatley&rsquo;s Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, the first book written by a sub-Saharan African in English, was therefore published by the Countess of Huntingdon in London in 1773. An overnight sensation in Europe, Wheatley was feted as a prodigy by London&rsquo;s literati. Returning to Boston, she was granted her freedom, and continued to write poetry, including one honoring George Washington. But her fame was fleeting. A proposed second poetry collection was sold off by her husband, John Peters, a pintlesmith who was perhaps born free, and who abandoned her. Wheatley suffered from asthma (a legacy of the Middle Passage) and the death of three children, before dying in poverty and obscurity, aged 31, in 1784.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EPhillis Wheatley was an inspiring example to nineteenth-century African American writers such as Ann Plato, Frances E.W.

She was a polyglot who knew English, Fulani, possibly some Arabic (she was observed soon after her purchase to be making strange, though indecipherable markings on a wall), and Latin. From West Africa to New England to England, she negotiated with considerable success the mixture of white cultures and languages which encircled the Atlantic. She was thus a fine example of what historians such as Ira Berlin, Linda Heywood, and John Thornton have classified as Atlantic Creoles.\\u003Cb\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\/b\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.50212\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by John Shields in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of African Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E.\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EVoyage of the Phillis, Slave Voyages&nbsp;\\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.slavevoyages.org\\/voyage\\/25481\\/variables\\\"\\u003Ehttp:\\/\\/www.slavevoyages.org\\/voyage\\/25481\\/variables\\u003C\\/a\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EPoetry Foundation \\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.poetryfoundation.org\\/poets\\/phillis-wheatley\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.poetryfoundation.org\\/poets\\/phillis-wheatley\\u003C\\/a\\u003E&nbsp;&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EMassachusetts Historical Society, Henry Louis Gates &amp; Peter Galison on Phillis Wheatley. &quot;No More, America&quot; \\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=DTT6qD5hoxE\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=DTT6qD5hoxE\\u003C\\/a\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPhillis Wheatley Historical Society \\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.phillis-wheatley.org\\/\\\"\\u003Ehttp:\\/\\/www.phillis-wheatley.org\\/\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\",\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ECarretta, Vincent, ed.

Ironically, Harry&#39;s unsuccessful attempt at freedom mirrored much of the language of his owner and other Revolutionary leaders in their quest for independence from England.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EDue to the increasing tensions between Britain and her American colonies, the Loyalist governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, issued a proclamation offering freedom to those slaves able to cross over to his feet. According to his proclamation issued on 14 November 1775, freedom would be granted to &ldquo;all indented servants, Negroes, or others &hellip; that are able to bear arms&rdquo; (Robert L. Scribner, Revolutionary Virginia, vol. 4, 334). On 24 July 1776 a small boat carrying three of General Washington&#39;s slaves offering their services to the British docked with the HMS Roebuck. Owing in part to an entry found in the Book of Negroes (which listed freedmen evacuated from New York by the British following the war), in which Harry states that he had run away from General Washington seven years earlier, Cassandra Pybus contends that Harry was among those brought aboard HMS Roebuck (Pybus, 19).\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ELord Dunmore hoped to form what he called the &ldquo;Ethiopian Regiment,&rdquo; a force of freedmen organized to fight in the southern colonies. However, depleting numbers, primarily due to smallpox epidemics among the freedmen, forced Lord Dunmore to leave Virginia for New York. On 7 August 1776 Harry and approximately two hundred to three hundred other surviving members of the Ethiopian Regiment and their families sailed along with Dunmore for New York. In New York, Harry worked for the Royal Artillery Department. Harry subsequently accompanied the British forces during their invasion of South Carolina, serving as a corporal in a corps of about sixty &ldquo;Black Pioneers&rdquo; with the Royal Artillery Department.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EWith the defeat of British forces and the surrender at Yorktown, an evacuation of the South became necessary. Those former slaves who could substantiate their role in aiding the British received a certificate of freedom and transport from Charleston. Harry had little difficulty proving eligibility for his certificate of freedom because of his many years of service with the Royal Artillery Department. As such, Harry took part in the final evacuation of Charleston and returned once more to New York. Terms of the provisional peace treaty, however, prohibited the removal of any slave property of Americans. Therefore, it became clear that if the British were to honor their pledge of freedom to escaped slaves they would need to be quickly removed from America. On 31 July 1783 Harry once again took part in an evacuation; this time leaving aboard L&#39;Abondance destined for Nova Scotia.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EThe freedmen and women faced numerous problems in Nova Scotia and ultimately found residency there to be unacceptable. Among other concerns, whites denied blacks the right to vote and adequate protections from violence. In response to these complaints, the prime minister agreed to pay the expenses for those willing to relocate to the new colony of Sierra Leone in Africa. The Sierra Leone Company, interested in attracting settlers, promised to provide twenty acres for every man, ten acres for each woman, and five acres for each child. Harry was among the approximately twelve hundred who chose to venture to Sierra Leone in November 1791. Harry&#39;s distaste for life in Nova Scotia can perhaps best be seen in viewing what he was willing to leave behind: two town lots, a home, and forty acres (Records of the British Colonial Office).\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EHarry soon found trouble in Sierra Leone as well. Local blacks wanted the opportunity to select their own leaders as opposed to having them appointed by the Sierra Leone Company. As a result, in 1800 a number of men began considering ways to limit the authority of the governor solely to the affairs of the Sierra Leone Company. In response to appeals from the governor, British troops and Maroons from Jamaica arrived in order to quell the potential uprising. Harry and twenty-nine others ultimately surrendered to the British authorities. In October 1800 a military tribunal sentenced Harry to be exiled across the Sierra Leone River to the Bullom Shore, where the exile community elected him as their leader. He later received amnesty and may have returned to Sierra Leone. The date and location of his death was not recorded.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.36591\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by William J.

Captured as a young boy, he was taken to America on a&nbsp; British slaver, arriving sometime in the spring of 1749. In-August, Charles Stewart or Steuart purchased Somerset, who was between eight and ten years old. In some accounts the surname is spelled, Somersett.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ESomerset lived in America for about two decades and then was taken to England in November 1769.&nbsp; Unlike most bondsmen in Virginia, Somerset did not work in the tobacco fields. Rather, he was&nbsp; Stewart&#39;s personal servant and valet. Stewart purchased fine clothing for Somerset, including silk&nbsp; stockings, and gave him some spending money. Scattered records suggest that Stewart had some&nbsp; affection for Somerset, treating him kindly, even generously, as a trusted servant and valet. Stewart&nbsp; owned a few other slaves in Virginia, but Somerset was the only one he took with him when he traveled&nbsp; to Massachusetts and other colonies.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EIn November 1769 Stewart moved to England, taking Somerset with him. Somerset continued as&nbsp; Stewart&#39;s servant and valet. There is no indication that Stewart mistreated Somerset or physically&nbsp; abused him. In February 1771 Somerset was baptized under the name of James Summersett, but he&nbsp; later adopted the more conventional spelling, Somerset. In October&nbsp; 1771, Somerset left Stewart and refused to return. On 26 November 1771 Stewart had Somerset&nbsp; seized, planning to ship him to the British Caribbean, where he would have been sold. However, this&nbsp; never happened. Friends of Somerset contacted the British abolitionist Granville Sharp, who sought a&nbsp; writ of habeas corpus from the Court of King&#39;s Bench. This case raised, for the first time, the status of&nbsp; the fifteen thousand or so slaves then in Great Britain.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EChief Justice William Murray, Lord Mansfield, strenuously urged the parties to settle the case. Stewart did not take the hint. His lawyers were paid for by wealthy Britons connected to the sugar&nbsp; trade who wanted to resolve the status of the slaves they brought to England. However, their lawyers&nbsp; should have understood that Mansfield was not likely to decide in their favor, because he ended the May hearing by urging Stewart to free Somerset. At the June term Mansfield reviewed the case and reduced the issue to the simple and narrow question:&nbsp; Could a slave owner maintain control of a slave in England, against the will of the slave? Mansfield&nbsp; concluded he or she could not.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EThe meaning of Somerset&#39;s case has been contested. It did not lead to an immediate end to slavery in&nbsp; Britain, and for the next half a century some slaves were taken there. But the case did give enslaved people in Britain a legal claim to freedom if they were savvy enough to make the claim. The case also created a&nbsp; powerful precedent for the idea that slavery could only exist where positive law created it. Many American states adopted the Somerset precedent, freeing slaves that entered their jurisdiction.&nbsp; However, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected it in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857).\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.36565\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Paul Finkelman in the \\u003Cem\\u003EAfrican American National Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EBenjamin Franklin. &ldquo;The Sommersett Case and the Slave Trade,&rdquo; The London Chronicle, June 18&ndash;20, 1772,&rdquo; in the United States National Archives \\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/founders.archives.gov\\/documents\\/Franklin\\/01-19-02-0128\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/founders.archives.gov\\/documents\\/Franklin\\/01-19-02-0128\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Cb\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\/b\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003E&quot;Slave or Free,&rdquo; British National Archives website.&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.nationalarchives.gov.uk\\/pathways\\/blackhistory\\/rights\\/slave_free.htm\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.nationalarchives.gov.uk\\/pathways\\/blackhistory\\/rights\\/\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nslave_free.htm\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EDavis, David Brion.

Legal documents indicate that in January 1830 Bryan brought Susan and his children to a plantation in Duval County, Florida.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EIn November 1842 Jacob Bryan executed a legal deed of manumission to emancipate Susan and several of his children, though the historical record is unclear as to whether Celia was one of those freed. Manumission of slaves had been possible in Florida under Spanish law, though usually for male slaves who had fought for the Spanish Empire, and for the common-law slave wives and slave children of white planters. As a result a sizeable free black population developed in eastern Florida, making it possible for interracial couples like Sarah and Jacob Bryan to live together openly.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EBy the time Jacob Bryan manumitted his slaves in 1842 Florida had enacted laws that severely restricted the rights of free blacks. These included a highly discriminatory poll tax, which required free blacks to pay an annual sum of eight dollars once they reached the age of fifteen, even though whites, beginning at the age of twenty-one, paid only one dollar each year. Free blacks could no longer vote, serve on juries, or testify against whites in court. They could not carry firearms, assemble in large groups, or sell liquor. The children of interracial couples could not inherit their parents&rsquo; property. An 1829 law also placed severe restrictions on the laws of manumission, requiring a fee of two hundred dollars per slave. Bryan, it appears, did not pay this fee when he freed his slave wife and children in 1842, perhaps because he could not afford it. Sarah and Bryan&#39;s children also did not conform to the law&#39;s requirement that freed slaves emigrate permanently from the state of Florida within thirty days of their manumission. Instead, they continued to live and work in Duval County, believing that they were free.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EThere is little in the historical record about Celia or her family until December 1847, at which time Celia was arrested on suspicion of having killed Jacob Bryan. At Celia&#39;s trial the following June, it emerged that she had been working in a field when Bryan approached her, perhaps to chastise or discipline her. Celia then attacked Bryan with her hoe, which had a knife attached to the handle. The blow &ldquo;cut open his skull so as to produce instant death&rdquo; (Schafer, 598). Some sources indicate that Celia had been aided in her attack by two male slaves, but it seems most likely that she acted alone. The six-man, all-white jury found Celia guilty only of manslaughter, probably in recognition that she had acted in self-defense and not with malice aforethought. That the jury also recommended clemency or mercy for Celia further suggests that they believed her actions were in some sense justifed. It emerged during the trial that Bryan was not only Celia&#39;s father but may have also been the father of Celia&#39;s four children, which may have earned her the sympathy of the jurors. Judge Thomas Douglas nevertheless sentenced her to death.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ECelia&#39;s trial and execution for killing Jacob Bryan also had severe repercussions for her mother and siblings. Susan Bryan and her children, including Dennis, Mary, and Sarah, were arrested and jailed as slaves; an inventory of Jacob Bryan&#39;s estate had classifed them all as slaves with a combined value of&nbsp;$3800. A seventeen-month investigation by a Florida judge found that Bryan had not fully complied with the state&#39;s manumission laws, but also recognized that it had been Bryan&#39;s intention to free his wife and children. Susan Bryan and her children were granted their freedom in March 1849, but the ruling was appealed by Jacob Bryan&#39;s brother, John, and his sister, Amaziah Archer, who claimed to be the rightful heirs to his property, including his slaves. In November 1851 Judge Thomas Douglas of Florida&#39;s Eastern Circuit Court ruled that Dennis, Mary, and their mother should be freed, but that Sarah, who had not been born in Florida, should be sold back into slavery. Three months later she was put up at a public auction in Jacksonville. In 1853 the Florida Supreme Court ruled that Dennis, Mary, and Jacob Bryan&#39;s other children, including Celia, had never been emancipated. Mary was probably returned to slavery; Dennis, who had been released from jail after wealthy whites guaranteed a $4000 bond, escaped. The court later awarded Amaziah Archer $900 to reimburse her for the loss of Dennis.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EThe case of the Florida slave Celia is in some respects similar to that of another slave named Celia , who was executed in Missouri in 1855 for killing her master who had repeatedly raped her from the moment he had purchased her as a fourteen year old in 1850. In both cases there appears to have been some sympathy for the accused, probably because both women had killed men who had abused them. In earlier times both women might have received clemency, but the growing sectional divisions over slavery probably sealed their fates. States like Missouri and Florida had become increasingly intolerant of any challenge to those who owned slaves, and so slaves who killed their masters could expect no mercy.

She was born free around 1760, either on Carriacou or Petit Martinique, near Grenada, to a white Frenchman and a free African woman he once owned and later freed. Judith&rsquo;s childhood coincided with the Seven Years War, when British colonial rule replaced French and slavery expanded rapidly. By 1778 enslaved Africans outnumbered whites on Carriacou by 29 to 1. A small number of slave owners were free people of color, including Judith&rsquo;s mother, Jeanette, who owns all of Petit Martinique and a 160-acre plantation on Carriacou, which Judith later inherited. The vast majority of African descended women and men on those islands, however, were enslaved and labored on sugar, coffee, and cotton plantations like Judith Phillip&rsquo;s Grand Anse. Through shrewd acquisitions she became one of the most respected and successful planters in the region. Her success continued through the early 19th century, despite the pro-French sympathies of her brother, Joachim, who aided Grenada&rsquo;s F&eacute;don Rebellion and slave uprising against the British in 1795.\\u003Cb\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\/b\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EJudith then forged a business and family alliance with William Thornton, a British attorney and estate manager.

When the British government abolished slavery in 1834, she received over 6,603 pounds sterling compensation for her property of 275 slaves.&nbsp; That wealth was created in Grenada and the Grenadines by enslaved labor and free colored owners but it was not reinvested on the islands.

The circumstances of Hilario&rsquo;s early childhood are unknown, but he was the preto rapaz Hilario, na&ccedil;&atilde;o Congo (black boy Hilario of the Congo na&ccedil;&atilde;o) who first appears in a register of Africans rescued from the Cezar, a Brazilian-flagged patacho (patache) that had departed from Ambriz, in the north of Angola, in early 1838. Purportedly loaded to transport &ldquo;free colonists&rdquo; between Angola and Mozambique, stopping in the River Plate for resupply, the ship was seized by a British anti trafficking corvette near the coast of Rio de Janeiro province in mid-April 1838. Historical records do not agree on the number of Africans loaded in Ambriz, and about 211 West Central Africans were rescued from a slaver that had been abandoned by its crew as the British patrol gave chase. Hilario was among approximately 120 children found on the Cezar.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EHilario then became what is known as a &ldquo;Free African,&rdquo; a discrete proper noun applied to Africans liberated under special legal conditions of the suppression of the slave trade. It is distinct from &ldquo;a free African,&rdquo; which would mean any African who was not enslaved. Hil&aacute;rio&rsquo;s multiple efforts to secure &ldquo;full freedom&rdquo; led to an important diplomatic-juridical exchange between the governments of Brazil and Britain in 1853&ndash;1854.\\u003Cb\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\/b\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EThe intimate details of Hilario&rsquo;s transition from boy to adult are not available, but we do know that he lived in an urban household on Rua da Quitanda, a bustling street in central Rio. His future facility with petitioning strongly suggests that he had the opportunity to become acculturated to Brazilian life, including a decent command of Portuguese. His first guardian, Joaquim Jos&eacute; dos Santos, was an assistant doorkeeper at the ministry of justice. Hilario was one of at least two Free Africans in the Santos household. When Santos died in 1845, Hilario&rsquo;s tutelage was transferred to Joaquim Martins Garrocho, a native of Portugal who held a post in the Brazilian navy until his death in 1852, at the age of 58. The Garrocho household included slaves; according, Hilario&mdash;like most Free Africans&mdash;direct knowledge of the regime of &ldquo;legal&rdquo; enslavement. Many Free Africans, British diplomats, and Brazilian proto-abolitionists would denounce the slave-like regime of harsh labor, frequent punishment, limited reproductive choice, and a lack of freedom of movement. However, none of the surviving petitions made in Hilario&rsquo;s name lodge such complaints.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EHilario&rsquo;s contact with other Free Africans continued to influence his actions as the Brazilian government adopted a muscular suppression of the clandestine trade while putting off British pressure for a liberalization of rules for those Liberated Africans, like Hilario, who had spent numerous years in compulsory apprenticeships. Upon the death of the second guardian and the widow&rsquo;s apparent disinterest in assuming tutelage, Hilario was sent to the House of Correction to await the disposition of his fate. From the main penal institution of the city of Rio, where he was in contact with convicts as well as numerous other Free Africans held &ldquo;on deposit,&rdquo; he began concerted efforts to convince Brazilian authorities to extend him the full rights of the free and to restore to him unpaid wages. The first petition came 22 February 1854. The second, dated one month later, denounced his being forced to live in a prison.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EUpon his departure from the corrections house, Hilario disappears from the historical records. But dozens of his shipmates from the Cezar can be tracked through the end of the legal regime over Free Africans in Brazil, abolished in 1864. Unlike many of his male shipmates on the Cezar, and the many other ships intercepted by British and Brazilian cruisers, Hilario left no registry of marriage or children. In this respect, his tactics for &ldquo;full freedom&rdquo; were quite distinct from those of his female contemporaries, such as Maria Angola, whose efforts to denounce the violation of her freedom were framed nearly entirely around the freedom of a son illegally enslaved by a maleficent guardian and his sister-in-law. Acting independently, and in gendered ways, Hilario Congo and Maria Angola, among many others, were still quite active participants in the construction of international human rights produced out of the suppression of the slave trade and the extension of freedom to the illegally enslaved in Brazil.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.74147\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Daryle Williams in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Online Resources\":null,\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cb id=\\\"docs-internal-guid-5b695a66-7fff-c4dd-f06e-ab7b50ac1116\\\"\\u003E&ldquo;\\u003C\\/b\\u003EThe Broken Paths of Freedom: Free Africans in Nineteenth-Century Brazilian Slave Society.&rdquo; Spatial History Project, Stanford University.&nbsp;\\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.stanford.edu.proxy2.cl.msu.edu\\/group\\/spatialhistory\\/cgi-bin\\/site\\/project.php?id=1069\\\"\\u003Ehttp:\\/\\/www.stanford.edu.proxy2.cl.msu.edu\\/group\\/spatial\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nhistory\\/cgi-bin\\/site\\/project.php?id=1069\\u003C\\/a\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EChalhoub, Sidney.

According to this account, Ukawsaw Gronniosaw was the youngest child of the oldest daughter of the king of Bournou. Spiritually dissatisfied with the animist faith in which he was raised, Ukawsaw alienated himself from his friends and relatives by his constant questions challenging their faith in physical objects, as well as by his growing belief in the existence of an uncreated creator.&nbsp;&quot;Dejected and melancholy,&rdquo; Gronniosaw accompanied a trading African merchant to the Gold Coast, more than a thousand miles from his home, where he had been promised that he could play with boys his own age and &ldquo;see houses walk upon the water with wings to them, and the white folks.&rdquo; The local king on the Gold Coast, however, thought him a spy and decided to behead him. Gronniosaw&rsquo;s obvious courage in the face of death caused the king to sell him into slavery instead.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EGronniosaw then successfully implored a Dutch captain to purchase him after a French slave trader refused to buy him because he was so small. Eventually, a wealthy Reformed Dutch clergyman in New Jersey bought Gronniosaw and introduced him to the English evangelist George Whitefield. Gronniosaw soon experienced despair when he became convinced that his own sins were too great to deserve salvation. Around 1747, after reading the spiritual writings of John Bunyan and Richard Baxter, an attempt at suicide, and a three-day illness, Gronniosaw was spiritually reborn when he recalled the biblical injunction, &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God.&rdquo; Gronniosaw&rsquo;s newfound happiness was quickly ended by the death of his master, who freed him in his will, and by recurrent spiritual doubts. As a free man, Gronniosaw worked for various members of his late master&rsquo;s family, all of whom, however, died within four years of the minister&rsquo;s death.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGronniosaw decided to go to England because his reading of religious texts by Englishmen led him to believe that there the &ldquo;people must be all Righteous.&rdquo; His innocence caused him to be cheated repeatedly, however, and he would soon come to believe that England was&nbsp;&lsquo;worse than Sodom&rsquo;. With George Whitfield&rsquo;s help, however, he found housing in London, where he married an English weaver despite his friends&rsquo; objections that she was a poor widow. Gronniosaw and his growing family soon fell on hard times because of the ongoing&nbsp;economic depression. Quaker contacts enabled Gronniosaw to find employment outside of London. Unfortunately, much of his work was seasonal, leading to long periods of deprivation and near-starvation during the winters. And he also faced racial discrimination. Ministers of various denominations refused to give his child a proper burial.

Her role in Haitian popular memory is similar to that of Betsy Ross in the United States, who is famed for crafting the nation&rsquo;s first flag and viewed as a symbol of women&rsquo;s participation in the American Revolution. Flon has also come to embody and symbolize the contributions of enslaved women that have historically been overlooked in Haiti--and throughout the African diaspora--in large part because detailed accounts of enslaved women are largely absent from the archival records on which many historians and writers have based their scholarship.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EMany accounts state that Flon was the goddaughter and principal assistant to Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the first ruler of the independent republic of Haiti. Because there is little archival evidence of her role in the overthrow of French colonial rule, some scholars, like Philipe Girard, deny her existence. Nonetheless, the persistence of Flon&rsquo;s story in oral tradition and popular memory speaks to a broader desire to commemorate the known participation of women in the Haitian Revolution that is largely silent in the archive. In the words of historian Nicole Willson, Flon&rsquo;s story highlights &ldquo;the symbiosis between revolutionary creativity and female domestic labour.&rdquo; (136)\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EMost popular accounts state that Flon was not only a seamstress but an enthusiastic supporter of the Haitian Revolution (1791&ndash;1804), during which time she served as a nurse, in a non-combatant but supportive capacity. Her unique place in the history of the revolution during the colonial war of independence (1802&ndash;1803), was precipitated by the revocation of the decret du 16 pluvi&ocirc;se an II, an attempt to reestablish chattel slavery that resulted in the French abduction of the Haitian revoluionary leader, Toussaint Louverture.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EThe design of the Haitian national flag occurred during a three-day meeting of the diverse revolutionary groups in May 1803, which was held at Archaye. It was during this conference that Dessalines is said to have symbolically excised the white vertical band from the French tricolor flag, leaving the red and blue bands.&nbsp; Flon, most accounts suggest, then stitched together the remaining bands.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ERevered and immortalized as one of the three most prominent women in the establishment of the nation-state of Haiti, Flon is integral to the mythology of the Haitian nation. She has been interpreted by many of Haiti&rsquo;s nationalist artists, all of whom paint her with the red and blue flag. Since 2000 a version of her likeness has adorned Haiti&rsquo;s ten-gourde banknote. A secondary school for girls was established in her honor. One of Haiti&rsquo;s national holidays, Flag Day, celebrated on 18 May, places her at the center of national history. In 2004 historian Laurent Dubois published Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution. Its paperback edition presents an image of the painting, &ldquo;Dessalines Ripping the White from the Flag,&rdquo; by the artist Madsen Mompremier. The oil on canvas painting places Catherine in the right corner, dressed in white, head wrapped, barefoot, and seated on a golden chair, stitching the red and blue bands of the new flag together. Apart from the ethereal figures, she is the only female mortal pictured. She seems to have turned her face away from her godfather. On the back cover of the book, Flon is presented as a detail from the painting.\\u003Cb\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\/b\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EDuring the two centuries since the Haitian nation declared independence, the design of the national flag has undergone changes. However, all artistic renditions of Catherine Flon have portrayed her stitching the blue and red bands of the French tricolor after the white was cut out by her godfather.\\u003Cb\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\/b\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EAs the historian Nicole Willson notes, &ldquo;even if there was no real personality named Catherine Flon, it might safely be assumed that there was at least one woman, if not a series of women, who were involved in the flag&rsquo;s creation at Arcahaie or elsewhere.&rdquo; (138) Moreover, there is documentary evidence that many enslaved seamstresses in pre-revolutionary Saint-Domingue rebelled and were involved in acts of espionage and resistance to the French colonial authorities.&nbsp; A database of records of runaways on St. Domingue, for example, includes a February 1784 notice for &ldquo;Madeleine, a Creole&rdquo; (Caribbean born) enslaved woman in her early twenties, who was &ldquo;an excellent seamstress and embroiderer, speaking good French...having been raised in Paris.&rdquo; Madeleine had escaped bondage 6 months earlier and was still at liberty. https:\\/\\/www.marronnage.info\\/fr\\/document.php?id=6710. Another woman, Marie, liberated herself the same year. A newspaper notice seeking her return described her as &ldquo;generally well dressed and has the vanity of passing herself off as free when it is not known.&rdquo; (Willson, 147).&nbsp; The persistence of the mythological memory of Catherine Flon in present-day Haiti, therefore, is representative of the actions of women like Marie, Madeleine, and others who resisted slavery and colonial rule.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.78749\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Curtis Jacobs in \\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.78749\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.78749\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EEmbassy of the Republic of Haiti to the United States. \\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.haiti.org\\/a-celebration-of-the-215th-anniversary-of-the-haitian-flag\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.haiti.org\\/a-celebration-of-the-215th-anniversary-of-the-haitian-flag\\/\\u003C\\/a\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EHaitian History Blog&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/haitianhistory.tumblr.com\\/post\\/618464333073170432\\/dessalines-ripping-the-white-from-the-flag-by\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eh\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/haitianhistory.tumblr.com\\/post\\/618464333073170432\\/dessalines-ripping-the-white-from-the-flag-by\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ettps:\\/\\/haitianhistory.tumblr.com\\/post\\/618464333073170432\\/dessalines-ripping-the-white-from-the-flag-by\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/haitianhistory.tumblr.com\\/post\\/618464333073170432\\/dessalines-ripping-the-white-from-the-flag-by\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EMarronnage in the Atlantic World: Sources and Life Trajectories.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nAn online database of 20, 000 documents recording self-liberation and other acts of resistance by enslaved people in Saint-Domingue, Jamaica, Louisiana, South Carolina, Canada, Guadeloupe, and French Guyana, from 1765-1833.\\u003Cb\\u003E \\u003C\\/b\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.marronnage.info\\/fr\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.marronnage.info\\/fr\\/\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EAccilien, C&eacute;cile, Jessica Adams, and Elimde M&eacute;&eacute;ance, eds.

In fact the Reverend Samuel Parris and his famous Arawak slave Tituba (often depicted as African) also were from Barbados and it was in Parris&rsquo;s household that the witch panic of 1692 began.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EOn July 2, 1692 Candy was arrested for the crime of witchcraft in a later wave of accusations made by villagers Mary Wallcot and Ann Putnam. Her name appears over four hundred times in the Salem Witchcraft court documents and she was famous for her violent, physical reaction to the accused; eighteen year old Mary Walcott, like most of the community of white and English descent, was also a frequent accuser. It is interesting and no doubt significant that Candy was not arrested in the first round of accusation, as Tituba had been; neither being a person of color or enslaved, it&nbsp; appeared, was enough to automatically attract the attention of the accusing girls.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EOnce arrested and examined, however, Candy used her position as an outsider to her advantage. Unlike the only other Black woman arrested, Mary Black, Candy confessed to her activity as a witch in some detail. She did not provide the sophisticated symbolic imagery of the devil and his color-coded animal familiars&mdash;such&nbsp; as the black dog, the yellow bird, and the red rat&mdash;as Tituba had done, rather offering material evidence of her Satanic actions. While spectral evidence was being used to convict others, Candy turned over physical objects that she asserted were part of her witch practice, including two pieces of&nbsp; cloth that she used for sympathetic magic in the manner of voodoo dolls. In the trial transcript there was dramatic evidence of the efficacy of these objects&mdash;three girls (Mary Warren, Deliverance Hobbs, and Abigail Hobbs) were afflicted by the pinching of the cloth, and when &ldquo;a bit of one of the rags being&nbsp; set on fire, the afflicted all said they were burned, and cried out dreadfully&rdquo; (Salem Witchcraft Papers, vol. 1).&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EWhile Candy&#39;s confessions show a strong understanding of European notions of witchcraft (and&nbsp; possibly African sorcery), her use of the court to accuse her mistress is of even greater significance. As an alien, and as an enslaved woman, she could be seen as powerless, and yet she was able to use her status to resist punishment in an effective fashion&mdash;she tied her fate to that of her free white owner. Her July 4, 1692 testimony includes the following exchange:\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EQ. Candy, are you a witch?\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EA. Candy, no witch in her country. Candy&#39;s mother no witch.

The truth of her testimony appeared to be corroborated by the spectral evidence offered by the accusing girls. All of this served to place Hawkes in jeopardy. According to the trial records, &ldquo;the&nbsp; black man and Mrs. Hawkes and the negro [Candy] stood by the puppets or rags and pinched them, and then they [the girls] were afflicted&rdquo; (Salem Witchcraft Papers, vol. 1). Candy&#39;s testimony implicating Hawkes played upon Puritan expectations:&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EQ.

In the end, as were all others who confessed, Candy was found not guilty of her crimes. She had&nbsp; successfully survived the onslaught that took many innocent lives. With the end of the trials Candy disappeared from the historical record and from popular memory, usurped by the Amerindian Tituba as the famous woman of color of the Salem Witch Trials.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/oxfordaasc.com\\/view\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.001.0001\\/acref-9780195301731-e-35502\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Timothy J.

Prince Klaas, as he is now known in Antigua was named&nbsp;&quot;Court&quot; in colonial records and sometimes called Tackey, and was born around 1690 in what is now Ghana.&nbsp;He was brought around 1701 as a captive to Antigua, a small British colony&nbsp;in the Leeward Islands of the Caribbean. His master, Thomas Kerby, was the speaker of the Antigua House of Assembly, and so trusted Court that he allowed him to &ldquo;carry on a Trade and many other greater Indulgencies than were allowed to any Slave in the Island&rdquo; (Gaspar, p. 235), allowing him not only freedom of movement around St. John&rsquo;s, the island&rsquo;s capital, but also the opportunity to earn and retain his own money. Tomboy, born in Antigua around 1690, was a highly skilled carpenter whose master, the merchant Thomas Hanson, allowed him to take on his own apprentices and pay Hanson a monthly sum, which&nbsp; constituted a fairly small proportion of his earnings. Like Klaas, his intelligence, skill, and seeming&nbsp; trustworthiness allowed him a degree of mobility and self-determination highly uncommon in Antigua&nbsp; and throughout the world of Atlantic slavery.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EIn October 1736 William Mathew, governor of the Leeward Islands colony, of which Antigua was the&nbsp; seat of government, claimed that he had discovered evidence of a plot. According to him, hundreds of&nbsp; local slaves and some allies among the island&rsquo;s free people of color planned to use the occasion of a&nbsp; ball in honor of the coronation of George II to kill the island&rsquo;s white elite, free themselves from slavery,&nbsp; and seize control of the island. Although Tomboy was supposedly more intimately involved in the mechanics of the affair, as he, in the&nbsp; guise of building seats in the ballroom, had allegedly planted gunpowder throughout the venue that he and his accomplices would ignite to blow up the attendees, it was Klaas who was said to have been the instigator of the conspiracy. Most notoriously, on Sunday, October 3, 1736, a large number of enslaved people had&nbsp; assembled on their day off in a pasture outside St. John&rsquo;s. It was common for captives to enjoy their&nbsp; leisure with dancing and festivity, but on this day Klaas, lavishly dressed, danced in the center of a ring of his fellow enslaved, raised a shield, and was apparently crowned as the king of the Coromantees, the Akan speaking ethnic group to which he belonged. While some attendees claimed that these actions were a harmless entertainment, the panicked Antiguan authorities, who both admired and feared the&nbsp; supposedly warlike nature of the Coromantee, ruled that Klaas would be executed the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both men were broken on the wheel, their bodies were burned, and their severed heads were mounted on poles and displayed outside the jail in which they had been confined as a warning to other enslaved and free people of color who challenged white colonial authority.&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nAlthough the conspiracy never came to fruition, and some Antiguan residents were skeptical that it&nbsp; even existed outside the fantasies of the enslaved and the anxieties of their owners, the lives of Klaas and Tomboy, described by the records of the investigation of their alleged plot, illuminate the&nbsp; possibilities and limitations of slave life in the eighteenth-century Caribbean. Tomboy was cast not as a&nbsp; skilled tradesman but as a dangerous interloper into the private spaces of the white elite, and Klaas&#39;s dignified demeanor was interpreted as evidence not of his good character but of his true nature as an African warrior who claimed royal authority.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/oxfordaasc.com\\/view\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.001.0001\\/acref-9780195301731-e-73713\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Natalie Zacek in \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro-Latin American Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EMike Dash, &ldquo;Antigua&rsquo;s Disputed Slave Conspiracy of 1736,&rdquo; Smithsonian Magazine, January 2, 2013.&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.smithsonianmag.com\\/history\\/antiguas-disputed-slave-conspiracy-of-1736-117569\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eh\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.smithsonianmag.com\\/history\\/antiguas-disputed-slave-conspiracy-of-1736-117569\\/\\\"\\u003Ettps:\\/\\/www.smithsonianmag.com\\/history\\/antiguas-disputed-slave-conspiracy-of-1736-117569\\/\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Source\":\"\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EDyde, Brian. \\u003Cem\\u003EA History of Antigua: The Unsuspected Isle.\\u003C\\/em\\u003E London: Macmillan Caribbean, 2000.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EGaspar, David Barry. \\u003Cem\\u003EBondmen and Rebels: A Study of Master-Slave Relations in Antigua\\u003C\\/em\\u003E.&nbsp; Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1985.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n&nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EMullin, Michael. \\u003Cem\\u003EAfrica in America: Slave Acculturation and Resistance in the American South&nbsp; and the British Caribbean, 1736&ndash;1831\\u003C\\/em\\u003E.

Slavery was legal in the state of New York in the final decade of the 18th century, and this probably prompted Jenny--and others-- to escape to neighboring Massachusetts, where the institution was abolished in 1783. A gradual emancipation law of 1799 freed the children of enslaved people born in New York after that date, but left Jenny and thousands of others born before the passage of the law in bondage.&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nThe only evidence of Jenny&rsquo;s early life is recorded in the Springfield vital records for 1802, which read: &ldquo;Jack Williams a negro Man and Jenny Cumfry a&nbsp; mulatto woman both of this town enter their Intention of Marriage this second day of Sept.

Their marriage was also recorded in the records of the First Church (Congregational) of Springfield where they are simply listed as &ldquo;Jack and Jenny.&rdquo; During this time the First Church was the main church in&nbsp; Springfield and their membership included most of the town&rsquo;s prominent (and overwhelmingly white) residents; therefore, it can be assumed&nbsp; that Jack and Jenny were well known and were at least to some degree accepted as part of the local community.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EIn 1808, however, a man of Dutch descent named Peter Van Geyseling (or &ldquo;Van Gyseling&rdquo;) whose family owned land around Schenectady traveled to Springfield to capture Jenny, claiming she was his property. The citizens of Springfield, led by Rev. Bezaleel Howard of the First Church, rallied to Jenny&rsquo;s assistance and, negotiated a sale price of $100 with Van Geyseling.

Her historicity and legendary status belend into one another, but she&nbsp;was most likely born into an Akan community in present-day Ghana around 1680.&nbsp;Dispossessed of her homeland sometime around the turn of the eighteenth century, she survived the&nbsp; Middle Passage across the Atlantic. In the legend that distinguishes Maroons from Jamaicans, Nanny and her sister, Sekesu, arrived in Jamaica. Nanny escaped into the mountains, establishing the lineage of Maroons; Sekesu remained enslaved, establishing the lineage of Jamaican non-Maroons. Alongside&nbsp;this mythical arrival in Jamaica, a growing consensus among contemporary Maroon leaders argues that&nbsp;Nanny arrived in Jamaica with her brother, Kojo, known in some accounts as Cudjoe.&nbsp; Kojo was the leader of the Leeward Maroons in the mountainous Cockpit Country in western Jamaica.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ENanny and Kojo plagued the British plantation owners and soldiers so fiercely that they forced the&nbsp;British to draw up a treaty with the Maroons, formally declaring their autonomy from the Crown in 1738 and 1739, and again in 1796. A 1741 land grant stipulates the gift of five hundred acres to Nanny&nbsp;and her people. This area, originally called New Nanny Town, is now called Moore Town, and on the&nbsp;annual Jamaican observance of National Heroes Day in mid-October, locals celebrate Nanny Day, commemorating the founder of their community. At some point during her life in Jamaica, it is possible that she married a man named Adou. She had no children, and yet all &ldquo;true-born Maroons&rdquo;&mdash;those who&nbsp; can trace an endogamous Maroon genealogy&mdash;claim her as their ancestor. It is believed that she died&nbsp; sometime in the 1750s.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ENanny&rsquo;s Maroon Town grew in the first half of the eighteenth century, following the social organization&nbsp;of matrifocal Akan society, and swelling to the size of between eight hundred and a thousand people.&nbsp; Protecting Nanny Town from invasion and administering spiritual and physical sustenance though&nbsp; natural and supernatural means marked the parameters of Nanny&rsquo;s responsibilities. While the colonists&nbsp; referred sparingly and negatively to the Maroons in their records, enforcing a kind of discursive&nbsp; invisibility on them and rendering them without history, the Maroons themselves made judicious use of&nbsp; the tactics of invisibility in guerilla warfare to obstruct the colonists&rsquo; desire to find, overtake, and&nbsp; enslave them. Nanny strategically positioned her community along a 900-foot precipice that&nbsp; overlooked the Stony River. From this position and from others nearby, she advised her Maroon&nbsp; warriors on the techniques of concealment, misdirection, and ambush. She covered them in branches&nbsp; and leaves, cloaking them from soldiers&rsquo; sight, and used an abeng, a cow&rsquo;s horn also used among Akan&nbsp; tribes, to signal the moment of surprise attack.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EIn the long-standing oral tradition recomposed by Windward and Leeward Maroons, Nanny is a central&nbsp; figure and the foremost ancestor of both groups. Several stories about Nanny recur, and some of them&nbsp; have their roots in the colonial writings on Jamaica. In colonial discourse, these stories seek to prove Nanny&rsquo;s diabolical use of obeah, a British term for West African-based witchcraft, but here referring to&nbsp;what Maroons describe as Nanny&rsquo;s oracular wisdom and science, or the mixture of natural and&nbsp; supernatural practices that make up her abilities. These Maroon stories reveal Nanny as an&nbsp;astoundingly gifted leader of her people, at times magically saving them from certain death. Three&nbsp; stories were transposed from the oral tradition and published in the Jamaican&nbsp;\\u003Cem\\u003EDaily Gleaner \\u003C\\/em\\u003Enewspaper\\u003Cem\\u003E&nbsp;\\u003C\\/em\\u003Eby the Maroon&nbsp;Colonel C. L. G. Harris in 1967, reformatting Nanny&rsquo;s achievements into written form, which catalyzed&nbsp; the effort to historicize this legendary figure of Jamaican national identity.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EThe story that is most repeated in the oral histories, and most critiqued by scholars of marronage,&nbsp;concerns Nanny&rsquo;s ability to catch and fire bullets with her buttocks&mdash;a tale that did not appear in print&nbsp;until Thomas&rsquo;s Untrodden Jamaica (1890). Twentieth-century writing on Nanny regularly refers to her&nbsp; bullet-catching abilities. Kamau Brathwaite and Carolyn Cooper have led the efforts to critique this&nbsp; talent rather than simply repeat it. In Wars of Respect (1977), Brathwaite suggests that while Nanny&rsquo;s&nbsp; abilities as a bullet catcher can be traced to similar alleged feats reported among African military&nbsp;maneuvers, the reference to the power of her buttocks is an attempt in colonial discourse to vulgarize&nbsp;and denigrate the fearsome power and presence that Nanny commanded. By focusing on one part of&nbsp;her body at the expense of considering the whole, colonial discourse and the oral histories of the&nbsp; Maroons commit a synecdochic violence on Nanny, eliding her other major qualities, such as leading,&nbsp;nurturing, and healing. Cooper highlights the empowering possibilities inherent in bodily acts&nbsp; committed by women, placing Nanny at the beginning of a practice by which Jamaican women assert&nbsp; authority through the self-conscious vulgarization of their own bodies. Brathwaite joins Cooper in&nbsp; consensus on this point in a 1994 reflection on Nanny, when he suggests that her bullet-catching feat is&nbsp; at the root of the Jamaican woman&rsquo;s practice of showing her backside to express insult toward another.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EAs a powerful Maroon leader and a Jamaican National Hero, Nanny is celebrated in oral history,&nbsp; scholarship, and imaginative writing as the quintessential Jamaican woman, and as the figure through&nbsp; which African traditions are translated into a Caribbean setting. To begin the study of Jamaican&nbsp; resistance history with Nanny argues that the story of the African diaspora begins not with &ldquo;slavery&nbsp; and conquest, but [with] the common human heritage of freedom and exploration&rdquo; (Cooper, 1994 , p.&nbsp;109). By this logic, the upright and powerful image of Nanny, refusing to countenance the British while&nbsp; nurturing her Maroon community and its descendants, replaces the paradigmatic image of the man in&nbsp; chains.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EIn the 1980s, Caribbean fiction began to incorporate Nanny and the stories associated with her as a&nbsp; way of reanimating folk traditions, histories of resistance, and feminist genealogies in the region. In Michelle Cliff&rsquo;s Clare Savage novels, \\u003Cem\\u003EAbeng\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (1984) and \\u003Cem\\u003ENo Telephone to Heaven\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (1987),&nbsp; Nanny appears as the spectral presence of refusal and resistance that guides the protagonist toward&nbsp; reclaiming a Jamaican identity. The Guadeloupean author Maryse Cond&eacute; takes a more critical approach&nbsp;to Nanny in her novella \\u003Cem\\u003ENanna-Ya\\u003C\\/em\\u003E (1999). Though none of Nanny&rsquo;s achievements&nbsp; are diminished in the&nbsp; novel, she has become an ancestral figure used by the modern-day Maroon characters to distinguish&nbsp;themselves from Jamaicans, cleaving national identity into those descended from freedom fighters and&nbsp;those descended from slaves.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nThe government of prime minister Michael Manley declared Nanny of the Maroons&nbsp;as a Jamaican National Hero in 1975.

The single available source about her life is a dictated biography published in England in 1863. According to this narrative, her mother worked as a house servant and her biological father, Henry Hope, was a white slave owner, planter, and partner in a clothing warehouse. Dinah&rsquo;s sister, also fathered by Hope, was born six months before Priscilla&rsquo;s death from consumption. Dinah was then raised by her grandparents, and although little is known about her childhood, she started working at her slave owner&rsquo;s house at age ten. She was abused and repeatedly beaten for small offenses; for example, when Dinah did not retrieve Henry&rsquo;s boots in a satisfactory time period, he kicked her on her right thigh.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EAt age thirteen, in the month of July or August, Dinah escaped from the plantation; however, on her second night away she experienced a frightening thunderstorm, later regretting that she had left at all. A few days after the storm, Dinah heard the sound of horses and chains rattling. Unfortunately, those sounds signaled that she had been captured. Her owner immediately threw her into jail. On Dinah&rsquo;s first night in prison, she received twenty\\u2010four lashes on her naked back for escaping from the plantation. Afterwards, she was jailed for five weeks. Upon release, Dinah was taken to Henry and was branded on her right shoulder and on the instep of her left foot.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EHenry Hope decided that Dinah would marry Jem Browne, so after they jumped the broom, they were&nbsp; declared husband and wife. Together they had fifteen children, including four sets of twins. Only three of their children survived past infancy: Priscilla, who was sold at age ten; an unnamed girl, who died from a sickness; and Charlie, who died shortly after being told he was to be sold. In 1855, after twenty years of marriage, Jem Browne died. He had never recovered from an assault by an overseer named Wildshaw who had beaten him with a hammer.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EIn 1860, Henry labeled Dinah &ldquo;useless&rdquo; because her children were grown, and because she would not marry Jones. She then determined to escape later that night. Throughout her escape, she faced several obstacles, but eventually found refuge in Pennsylvania for four months with a white clergyman, up until March 1861, just before the beginning of the American Civil War. To maintain her freedom, Dinah boarded a ship in New York that took her first to Calcutta, India, where she lived for several months. After another long voyage, she arrived in London, England, in March 1863. While in London, she stayed with an unidentified woman. To earn a living, Dinah did needlework; but, due to the physical violence she had endured for the greater part of her life, it was very difficult for her to work because of the intense pain from the eleven scars she bore on her body.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EDuring her time in England Dinah dictated her life story to John Hawkins Simpson, who published Horrors of the Virginia Slave Trade &hellip;The True Story of Dinah, an Escaped Virginian Slave in December 1863. The narrative depicts the humanity of Browne and other enslaved African Americans and sought to encourage sympathy for abolition among British readers at a time when there was significant support for the Confederacy. It also argues that the system of slavery was contrary to Christianity, the ideal of social equality, and the spirit of the 1776 American Declaration of Independence.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EAfter the publication of this biography, Dinah disappears from the historical record.

Jordan (2005) who describes it as &ldquo;an explicit eyewitness account of Virginia slavery.&rdquo; (158).&nbsp; Professor John Blassingame, however, in his magisterial Slave Testimony (1972) states that Brown&rsquo;s narrative is overly focused on her flight from bondage and includes it in a list of narratives that are &ldquo;unreliable&rdquo; (xxviii) as a guide to&nbsp; the details of slave life.&nbsp;\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.013.38513\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by Adele N.

Born on the coast of West Africa in what is present day Benin, Redoshi was one of about 110 West African children and adults who were human cargo of the schooner Clotilda, the last slave ship to reach the United States. In July of 1860, the Clotilda docked in Mobile Bay, Alabama, even though federal law had banned the importation of slaves to the United States since 1808. Redoshi&nbsp; outlived all other known Clotilda survivors with the exception of Matilda McCrear, who died in January 1940. Another Clotilda survivor, Kossola\\/Cudjo Lewis, died in 1935. Very little is known about Redoshi&rsquo;s early life, although a newspaper article suggested that she was the daughter-in-law of a chief and that her father upheld the law in their community (Montgomery Advertiser, 31 January 1932). Descriptions of Redoshi&rsquo;s kidnapping by Dahomean slave traders indicate that, similar to many of her fellow Clotilda survivors, she was a member of a Yoruba community that was raided on or around February 16, 1860.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EKing Glele of Dahomey led the raid on Redoshi&rsquo;s town. Glele&rsquo;s father, King Ghezo, had signed a treaty&nbsp; with Great Britain in 1852 that formally abolished the export of slaves overseas. However, a decline in&nbsp; the price of palm oil and resurgence of the Cuban slave trade meant that an overt trade in slaves soon&nbsp; resumed within the West African kingdom. When Ghezo died in 1858, Glele expanded his father&rsquo;s slave&nbsp; raiding campaigns. Redoshi claimed that the Dahomean warriors who kidnapped her wet her town&rsquo;s gunpowder to ensure that the community could not defend itself before launching a surprise night&nbsp; attack. The survivors of the raid were then marched to the slave port of Ouidah. Redoshi suggested&nbsp; that this journey took four days. The captives were then locked for three weeks in a slave pen, or barracoon, alongside other raid survivors and kidnap victims before being selected for sale to the U.S.&nbsp; for $100 each.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EThe voyage from West Africa to Mobile lasted for around forty-five days. Redoshi stated that at least two people died from sickness on board the ship and thrown out to sea, consequently. Upon arrival in Mobile the Clotilda survivors were smuggled upriver in an effort to conceal their illegal purchase and journey from U.S. authorities. Although the schooner was burned and sunk, remains of the Clotilda were finally identified at the bottom of the Mobile River in May 2019.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EMost of the Clotilda survivors stayed in Mobile because they were enslaved to the Meaher family. The groups of men and women&nbsp; managed to reunite after the Civil War. They purchased land from their former owners and created&nbsp; their own community, known as African Town, the first U.S. town to be run continuously by black people and the only one founded by Africans. However, Redoshi, her husband, Yawith, and at least two other Africans were sent to Bank of Selma founder Washington Smith&rsquo;s plantation in Bogue Chitto, Dallas County. According to Amelia Boynton Robinson, a community leader and voting rights activist who interviewed Redoshi in the 1930s, Redoshi was a twelve-year-old girl when she was sold and married to Yawith, a much older man from a different ethnic group.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EWhen Redoshi arrived at the Smith plantation, they renamed her Sally or Sallie and her husband, Yawith, became known as William or Billy Smith. The couple was enslaved to Washington Smith for the next five years and worked in both his house and cotton fields. After the Civil War formally granted them their freedom, Redoshi and Yawith continued to labor as sharecroppers on the Smith plantation. Redoshi and Yawith found that the amount of cotton that they produced was miscounted when they tried to sell it. This was a common practice by plantation owners and merchants in&nbsp; the Black Belt that was designed to keep black farmers in perpetual debt to white landlords. In&nbsp; response, Yawith developed a system for recording independently the amount of cotton that he&nbsp; produced. Together, Redoshi and Yawith had a daughter to whom they gave a West African name, which was recorded variously on census and marriage data as Leasy, Luth A., Lethe, Lethia, Letia, and Lethy. Boynton Robinson also recalled that Redoshi had several great-grandchildren and that some became public school teachers and ministers.\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ERedoshi and other Clotilda captives were among the few African-born slaves who lived through the&nbsp; Civil War, Reconstruction, and Jim Crow. More notably for a survivor of the transatlantic slave&nbsp;trade, Redoshi witnessed the activist beginnings of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement through her&nbsp;associations with Amelia Boynton Robinson and Bogue Chitto. Redoshi was buried on the plantation where she had been enslaved. Records evidence that Redoshi remained committed to her West African spiritual beliefs and language throughout her life.&nbsp;\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EIn the last year of her life, Redoshi appeared in the U.S. Department of Agriculture film The Negro Farmer: Extension Work for Better Farming and Better Living (1938). This recording of Redoshi is the only known footage of a female African born transatlantic slave trade survivor. Although she is shown talking on film, tragically her voice is silenced in the brief clip, over which a white narrator intones.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/oxfordaasc.com\\/view\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.001.0001\\/acref-9780195301731-e-78918\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003ERead the full, original biography by&nbsp;\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http:\\/\\/oxfordaasc.com\\/view\\/10.1093\\/acref\\/9780195301731.001.0001\\/acref-9780195301731-e-78918\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EHannah Durkin in the&nbsp;\\u003Cem\\u003EAfrican American National Biography\\u003C\\/em\\u003E.\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003C\\/p\\u003E\\r\\n\",\"Online Resources\":\"\\u003Cp dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003ESlave Voyages.\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Ca href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.slavevoyages.org\\/voyage\\/36990\\/variables\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehttps:\\/\\/www.slavevoyages.org\\/voyage\\/36990\\/variables\\u003C\\/a\\u003E\\u003Cbr \\/\\u003E\\r\\nThe Clotilda was the last of 29 ships that attempted to disembark enslaved African people illegally at United States ports in the years following the federal Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves of 1807.
